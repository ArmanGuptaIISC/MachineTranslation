Perceptual intent causes the full gamut of the image to be compressed or expanded to fill the gamut of the destination device, so that gray balance is preserved but colorimetric accuracy may not be preserved. In other words, if certain colors in an image fall outside of the range of colors that the output device can render, the image intent will cause all the colors in the image to be adjusted so that the every color in the image falls within the range that can be rendered and so that the relationship between colors is preserved as much as possible. This intent is most suitable for display of photographs and images, and is the default intent. Absolute Colorimetric intent causes any colors that fall outside the range that the output device can render to be adjusted to the closest color that can be rendered, while all other colors are left unchanged. This intent preserves the white point and is most suitable for spot colors (Pantone, TruMatch, logo colors,....) Relative Colorimetric intent is defined such that any colors that fall outside the range that the output device can render are adjusted to the closest color that can be rendered, while all other colors are left unchanged. Proof intent does not preserve the white point. Saturation intent preserves the saturation of colors in the image at the possible expense of hue and lightness. Implementation of this intent remains somewhat problematic, and the ICC is still working on methods to achieve the desired effects. This intent is most suitable for business graphics such as charts, where it is more important that the colors be vivid and contrast well with each other rather than a specific color.

This area contains a CIE or chromaticity diagram. A CIE diagram is a representation of all the colors that a person with normal vision can see. This is represented by the colored sail-shaped area. In addition you will see a triangle that is superimposed on the diagram outlined in white. This triangle represents the outer boundaries of the color space of the device that is characterized by the inspected profile. This is called the device gamut. In addition there are black dots and yellow lines on the diagram. Each black dot represents one of the measurement points that were used to create this profile. The yellow line represents the amount that each point is corrected by the profile, and the direction of this correction.

Select the blurring effect to apply to image. Zoom Blur: blurs the image along radial lines starting from a specified center point. This simulates the blur of a zooming camera. Radial Blur: blurs the image by rotating the pixels around the specified center point. This simulates the blur of a rotating camera. Far Blur: blurs the image by using far pixels. This simulates the blur of an unfocalized camera lens. Motion Blur: blurs the image by moving the pixels horizontally. This simulates the blur of a linear moving camera. Softener Blur: blurs the image softly in dark tones and hardly in light tones. This gives images a dreamy and glossy soft focus effect. It is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photographs, or giving images a warm and subtle glow. Shake Blur: blurs the image by shaking randomly the pixels. This simulates the blur of a random moving camera. Focus Blur: blurs the image corners to reproduce the astigmatism distortion of a lens. Smart Blur: finds the edges of color in your image and blurs them without muddying the rest of the image. Frost Glass: blurs the image by randomly disperse light coming through a frosted glass. Mosaic: divides the photograph into rectangular cells and then recreates it by filling those cells with average pixel value.
Distance:
Set here the blur distance in pixels.
This value controls the level to use with the current effect.

Brush size:
Set here the brush size to use for simulating the oil painting.
This value controls the smoothing effect of the brush under the canvas.
Infrared
Set here the ISO-sensitivity of the simulated infrared film. Increasing this value will increase the proportion of green color in the mix. It will also increase the halo effect on the highlights, and the film graininess (if that box is checked). Note: to simulate an Ilford SFX200 infrared film, use a sensitivity excursion of 200 to 800. A sensitivity over 800 simulates Kodak HIE high-speed infrared film. This last one creates a more dramatic photographic style.

Method:

Sharpness:
A sharpness of 0 has no effect, 1 and above determine the sharpen matrix radius that determines how much to sharpen the image.
Radius value is the Gaussian blur matrix radius value used to determines how much to blur the image.
The value of the difference between the original and the blur image that is added back into the original.
The threshold, as a fraction of the maximum luminosity value, needed to apply the difference amount.
Circular sharpness:
This is the radius of the circular convolution. It is the most important parameter for using this plugin. For most images the default value of 1.0 should give good results. Select a higher value when your image is very blurred.
Correlation:
Increasing the correlation may help to reduce artifacts. The correlation can range from 0-1. Useful values are 0.5 and values close to 1, e. g. 0.95 and 0.99. Using a high value for the correlation will reduce the sharpening effect of the plugin.
Noise filter:
Increasing the noise filter parameter may help to reduce artifacts. The noise filter can range from 0-1 but values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. When the noise filter value is too low, e. g. 0.0 the image quality will be very poor. A useful value is 0.01. Using a high value for the noise filter will reduce the sharpening effect of the plugin.
Gaussian sharpness:
This is the sharpness for the Gaussian convolution. Use this parameter when your blurring is of a Gaussian type. In most cases you should set this parameter to 0, because it causes nasty artifacts. When you use non-zero values, you will probably also have to increase the correlation and/ or noise filter parameters.
Matrix size:
This parameter determines the size of the transformation matrix. Increasing the matrix width may give better results, especially when you have chosen large values for circular or Gaussian sharpness.

Use BPC
The Black Point Compensation (BPC) feature works in conjunction with Relative Colorimetric Intent. With Perceptual Intent, it should make no difference, since BPC is always on, and with Absolute Colorimetric, Intent it is always turned off. BPC compensates for a lack of ICC profiles for rendering dark tones. With BPC the dark tones are optimally mapped (no clipping) from original the medium to the destination rendering medium, e. g. the combination of paper and ink.
Rendering Intent:
Perceptual intent causes the full gamut of the image to be compressed or expanded to fill the gamut of the destination media, so that gray balance is preserved but colorimetric accuracy may not be preserved. In other words, if certain colors in an image fall outside of the range of colors that the output device can render, the image intent will cause all the colors in the image to be adjusted so that every color in the image falls within the range that can be rendered and so that the relationship between colors is preserved as much as possible. This intent is most suitable for display of photographs and images, and is the default intent. Absolute Colorimetric intent causes any colors that fall outside the range that the output device can render to be adjusted to the closest color that can be rendered, while all other colors are left unchanged. This intent preserves the white point and is most suitable for spot colors (Pantone, TruMatch, logo colors,...). Relative Colorimetric intent is defined such that any colors that fall outside the range that the output device can render are adjusted to the closest color that can be rendered, while all other colors are left unchanged. Proof intent does not preserve the white point. Saturation intent preserves the saturation of colors in the image at the possible expense of hue and lightness. Implementation of this intent remains somewhat problematic, and the ICC is still working on methods to achieve the desired effects. This intent is most suitable for business graphics such as charts, where it is more important that the colors be vivid and contrast well with each other rather than a specific color.

Auto Correction
The auto-color correction tool preview is shown here. Picking a color on the image will show the corresponding color level on the histogram.
Auto Levels
Auto Levels: This option maximizes the tonal range in the Red, Green, and Blue channels. It searches the image shadow and highlight limit values and adjusts the Red, Green, and Blue channels to a full histogram range.
Normalize
Normalize: This option scales brightness values across the active image so that the darkest point becomes black, and the brightest point becomes as bright as possible without altering its hue. This is often a "magic fix" for images that are dim or washed out.
Equalize
Equalize: This option adjusts the brightness of colors across the active image so that the histogram for the value channel is as nearly as possible flat, that is, so that each possible brightness value appears at about the same number of pixels as each other value. Sometimes Equalize works wonderfully at enhancing the contrasts in an image. Other times it gives garbage. It is a very powerful operation, which can either work miracles on an image or destroy it.
Stretch Contrast
Stretch Contrast: This option enhances the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by stretching the lowest and highest values to their fullest range, adjusting everything in between.
Auto Exposure
Auto Exposure: This option enhances the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image to calculate optimal exposition and black level using image histogram properties.

NoiseReduction
Radius: this control selects the gliding window size used for the filter. Larger values do not increase the amount of time needed to filter each pixel in the image but can cause blurring. This window moves across the image, and the color in it is smoothed to remove imperfections. In any case it must be about the same size as the noise granularity or somewhat more. If it is set higher than necessary, then it can cause unwanted blur.
Threshold: use the slider for coarse adjustment, and the spin control for fine adjustment to control edge detection sensitivity. This value should be set so that edges and details are clearly visible and noise is smoothed out. Adjustment must be made carefully, because the gap between "noisy", "smooth", and "blur" is very small. Adjust it as carefully as you would adjust the focus of a camera.
Texture:
Texture: this control sets the texture accuracy. This value can be used, to get more or less texture accuracy. When decreased, then noise and texture are blurred out, when increased then texture is amplified, but also noise will increase. It has almost no effect on image edges.
Sharpness: This value improves the frequency response for the filter. When it is too strong then not all noise can be removed, or spike noise may appear. Set it near to maximum, if you want to remove very weak noise or JPEG-artifacts, without losing detail.
Edge Lookahead:
Edge: This value defines the pixel distance to which the filter looks ahead for edges. When this value is increased, then spike noise is erased. You can eventually re-adjust the Edge filter, when you have changed this setting. When this value is too high, the adaptive filter can no longer accurately track image details, and noise or blurring can occur.
Erosion:
Erosion: Use this to increase edge noise erosion and spike noise erosion (noise is removed by erosion).
Luminance: this control sets the luminance tolerance of the image. Using either the Color or the Luminance tolerance settings to make an image correction is recommended, but not both at the same time. These settings do not influence the main smoothing process controlled by the Details settings.
Color: this control sets the color tolerance of the image. It is recommended using either the Color or the Luminance tolerance to make image correction, not both at the same time. These settings do not influence the main smoothing process controlled by the Details settings.
Gamma: this control sets the gamma tolerance of the image. This value can be used to increase the tolerance values for darker areas (which commonly are noisier). This results in more blur for shadow areas.
Damping:
Damping: this control sets the phase-jitter damping adjustment. This value defines how fast the adaptive filter-radius reacts to luminance variations. If increased, then edges appear smoother; if too high, then blur may occur. If at minimum, then noise and phase jitter at the edges can occur. It can suppress spike noise when increased, and this is the preferred method to remove it.

Using this menu, you can select from the four following snapshot modes: Full Screen - captures the entire desktop. Window Under Cursor - captures only the window (or menu) that is under the mouse cursor when the snapshot is taken. Region - captures only the region of the desktop that you specify. When taking a new snapshot in this mode you will be able to select any area of the screen by clicking and dragging the mouse. Section of Window - captures only a section of the window. When taking a new snapshot in this mode you will be able to select any child window by moving the mouse over it.

Your images/ videos are not sorted, which means that navigating using the date bar will only work suboptimally. In the Maintenance menu, you can find Display Images with Incomplete Dates which you can use to find the images that are missing date information. You can then select the images that you have reason to believe have a correct date in either their EXIF data or on the file, and execute Maintenance- > Read EXIF Info to reread the information. Finally, once all images have their dates set, you can execute Images- > Sort Selected by Date & Time to sort them in the database.
Images/ Videos Are Not Sorted
Not all the images in the database have information about image sizes; this is needed to get the best result in the thumbnail view. To fix this, simply go to the Maintainance menu, and first choose Remove All Thumbnails, and after that choose Build Thumbnails. Not doing so will result in extra space around images in the thumbnail view - that is all - so there is no urgency in doing it.
Not All Images Have Size Information

Welcome to KPhotoAlbum Import This wizard will take you through the steps of an import operation. The steps are: First you must select which images you want to import from the export file. You do so by selecting the checkbox next to the image. Next you must tell KPhotoAlbum in which directory to put the images. This directory must of course be below the directory root KPhotoAlbum uses for images. KPhotoAlbum will take care to avoid name clashes The next step is to specify which categories you want to import (People, Places,...) and also tell KPhotoAlbum how to match the categories from the file to your categories. Imagine you load from a file, where a category is called Blomst (which is the Danish word for flower), then you would likely want to match this with your category, which might be called Blume (which is the German word for flower) - of course given you are German. The final steps, is matching the individual tokens from the categories. I may call myself Jesper in my image database, while you want to call me by my full name, namely Jesper K. Pedersen. In this step non matches will be highlighted in red, so you can see which tokens was not found in your database, or which tokens was only a partial match.

How to Handle Images

Manual copy next to. kim file
Automatically copy next to. kim file
Hard link next to. kim file
Compress export file
Generate thumbnails
Limit maximum image dimensions to:
If your images are stored in a non-compressed file format then you may check this; otherwise, this just wastes time during import and export operations. In other words, do not check this if your images are stored in jpg, png or gif; but do check this if your images are stored in tiff.
Generate thumbnail images
With this option you may limit the maximum dimensions (width and height) of your images. Doing so will make the resulting export file smaller, but will of course also make the quality worse if someone wants to see the exported images with larger dimensions.
When exporting images, bear in mind that there are two things the person importing these images again will need: 1) meta information (image content, date etc.) 2) the images themselves. The images themselves can either be placed next to the. kim file, or copied into the. kim file. Copying the images into the. kim file works well for a recipient who wants all, or most of those images, for example when emailing a whole group of images. However, when you place the images on the Web, a lot of people will see them but most likely only download a few of them. It works better in this kind of case, to separate the images and the. kim file, by place them next to each other, so the user can access the images s/ he wants.

Other KPhotoAlbum users may now load the import file into their database, by choosing import in the file menu. If they find it on a web site, and the web server is correctly configured, all they need to do is simply to click it from within konqueror. To enable this, your web server needs to be configured for KPhotoAlbum. You do so by adding the following line to / etc/ httpd/ mime. types or similar: application/ vnd. kde. kphotoalbum-import kim This will make your web server tell konqueror that it is a KPhotoAlbum file when clicking on the link, otherwise the web server will just tell konqueror that it is a plain text file.

Description
On KPhotoAlbum's home page (http: / /www. kphotoalbum. org/) you may see a few videos featuring a number of different KPhotoAlbum features.
It is possible to create new categories - that are alternatives to People, Places, and Events - in the annotation dialog. To add new categories or remove existing ones, go to the Settings-gt; Configure KPhotoAlbum dialog, and choose Categories in the side bar.
You may rename or delete a person, location, keyword or similar by right-clicking on the item in the image property dialog.
When generating HTML you must specify a base directory for the images. Here you can specify any protocol supported by KDE, like ftp or fish. Examples: ftp: / /someserver/ my-upload-area/ images (upload using FTP) fish: / /someserver/ home/ foo/ images (upload using ssh) smb: / /someserver/ c/ images (upload to a Windows share)
When you bring new images to your collection, you might not have time right away to categorize them (i. e. specify People, Places, etc.). Therefore, you might later want to find those images which have not yet been categorized. Here is what I do. I use the keyword OK, which I set on images, once I've categorized them (i. e. just like you may have a keyword for Summer Party or Interrail trip 1990, you now have a keyword OK). To find uncategorized images, I choose the Search item from the browser, and in the keywords field, I type! OK. This will find all images which do not have the OK item.
You can reorder images on your hard disk after having loaded them into KPhotoAlbum - KPhotoAlbum will still remember them, as it calculates checksums for the images.
If you like KPhotoAlbum, and it adds value to your daily life, please consider donating money to the KPhotoAlbum developer as a courtesy. See http: / /www. kphotoalbum. org/ support. htm.
It's possible to associate images with categories. That way when browsing, say people, you may get a small icon for each person with e. g. the person's face. To specify an icon for a person, load the person in the viewer, zoom to the part which you want to make into an icon, and choose Show Category Editor. This will bring up a dialog where you can find the person, and set the image.
You may close the image annotation dialog (the one where you specify people, places, etc. for the images) by pressing Ctrl+Enter.
KPhotoAlbum has a mailing list at http: / /klaralvdalens-datakonsult. se/ mailman/ listinfo/ kphotoalbum, and an IRC channel named #kphotoalbum on irc. kde. org.
You may reorder images by dragging and dropping one image onto another. If you drop it on the left edge, it will end up in front of the other, if you drop it on the right edge it will be inserted behind. -- Tip contributed by Eivind Kjorstad
On the thumbnail view, you can resize the grid to your needs just by clicking the middle mouse button and dragging around. On most systems you can emulate the middle mouse button by left and right clicking at the same time. -- Tip contributed by Rafael Beccar
This is the last tip. If you know any additional tips or tricks, then please send an email to blackie@kde. org.

Due to a shortcoming in KPhotoAlbum, you need to save your database after renaming categories; otherwise all the filenames of the category thumbnails will be wrong, and thus lost. So either press Cancel now (and it will not be renamed), or press Continue, and as your next step save the database.

KPhotoAlbum will try to read the image date from EXIF information in the image. If that fails it will try to get the date from the file's time stamp. However, this information will be wrong if the image was scanned in (you want the date the image was taken, not the date of the scan). If you only scan images, in contrast to sometimes using a digital camera, you should reply no. If you never scan images, you should reply yes, otherwise reply ask. This will allow you to decide whether the images are from the scanner or the camera, from session to session.
JPEG images may contain information about rotation. If you have a reason for not using this information to get a default rotation of your images, uncheck this check box. Note: Your digital camera may not write this information into the images at all.
JPEG images may contain a description. Check this checkbox to specify if you want to use this as a default description for your images.
KPhotoAlbum is capable of searching for new images and videos when started, this does, however, take some time, so instead you may wish to manually tell KPhotoAlbum to search for new images using Maintenance- > Rescan for new images
KPhotoAlbum is capable of reading certain kinds of RAW images. Some cameras store both a RAW image and a matching JPEG or TIFF image. This causes duplicate images to be stored in KPhotoAlbum, which may be undesirable. If this option is checked, KPhotoAlbum will not read RAW files for which matching image files also exist.
KPhotoAlbum shares plugins with other imaging applications, some of which have the concept of albums. KPhotoAlbum does not have this concept; nevertheless, for certain plugins to function, KPhotoAlbum behaves to the plugin system as if it did. KPhotoAlbum does this by defining the current album to be the current view - that is, all the images the browser offers to display. In addition to the current album, KPhotoAlbum must also be able to give a list of all albums; the list of all albums is defined in the following way: When KPhotoAlbum's browser displays the content of a category, say all People, then each item in this category will look like an album to the plugin. Otherwise, the category you specify using this option will be used; e. g. if you specify People with this option, then KPhotoAlbum will act as if you had just chosen to display people and then invoke the plugin which needs to know about all albums. Most users would probably want to specify Events here.

KPhotoAlbum is capable of backing up the index. xml file by keeping copies named index. xml~1~ index. xml~2~ etc. and you can use the spinbox to specify the number of backup files to keep. KPhotoAlbum will delete the oldest backup file when it reaches the maximum number of backup files. The index. xml file may grow substantially if you have many images, and in that case it is useful to ask KPhotoAlbum to zip the backup files to preserve disk space.
KPhotoAlbum is using a single index. xml file as its data base. With lots of images it may take a long time to read this file. You may cut down this time to approximately half, by checking this check box. The disadvantage is that the index. xml file is less readable by human eyes.

Feature Status
Overview Below you may see the list of compile- and runtime features KPhotoAlbum has, and their status: %1
What can I do if I miss a feature? If you compiled KPhotoAlbum yourself, then please review the sections below to learn what to install to get the feature in question. If on the other hand you installed KPhotoAlbum from a binary package, please tell whoever made the package about this defect, eventually including the information from the section below. In case you are missing a feature and you did not compile KPhotoAlbum yourself, please do consider doing so. It really is n't that hard. If you need help compiling KPhotoAlbum, feel free to ask on the KPhotoAlbum mailing listThe steps to compile KPhotoAlbum can be seen on the KPhotoAlbum home page. If you have never compiled a KDE application, then please ensure that you have the developer packages installed, in most distributions they go under names like kdelibs-devel
Plug-ins SupportKPhotoAlbum has a plug-in system with lots of extensions. You may among other things find plug-ins for: Writing images to cds or dvd'sAdjusting timestamps on your imagesMaking a calendar featuring your imagesUploading your images to flickrUpload your images to facebookThe plug-in library is called KIPI, and may be downloaded from the KIPI Home page
EXIF support Images store information like the date the image was shot, the shooting angle, focal length, and shutter-speed in what is known as EXIF information. KPhotoAlbum uses the EXIV2 library to read EXIF information from images
SQL Database Support KPhotoAlbum allows you to search using a certain number of EXIF tags. For this KPhotoAlbum needs an Sqlite database. In addition the qt package for sqlite (e. g. qt-sql-sqlite) must be installed.
Video Thumbnails SupportKPhotoAlbum asks the KDE plug-in system for help when it needs to generate a thumbnail for videos. Unfortunately KDE4 does currently not come with any plug-ins for this, you therefore need manually to install MPlayerThumbs.
Video Support KPhotoAlbum relies on Qt's Phonon architecture for displaying videos; this in turn relies on GStreamer. If this feature is not enabled for you, have a look at the KPhotoAlbum wiki article on video support.

Welcome to KPhotoAlbumIf you are interested in trying out KPhotoAlbum with a prebuilt set of images, then simply choose the Load Demo button. You may get to this demo at a later time from the Help menu. Alternatively you may start making you own database of images, simply by pressing the Create my own database button.

KPhotoAlbum requires that all your images and videos are stored with a common root directory. You are allowed to store your images in a directory tree under this directory. KPhotoAlbum will not modify or edit any of your images, so you can simply point KPhotoAlbum to the directory where you already have all your images located.

Delete Your Temporary Demo Database I hope you enjoyed the KPhotoAlbum demo. The demo database was copied to / tmp, should it be deleted now? If you do not delete it, it will waste disk space; on the other hand, if you want to come back and try the demo again, you might want to keep it around with the changes you made through this session.

Mount root filesystem & read-only
Mount the root filesystem for this kernel read-only. Since the init scripts normally take care of remounting the root filesystem in read-write mode after running some checks, this should always be turned on. Do not turn this off unless you know what you are doing.
Do not check & partition table
This turns off some sanity checks while writing the configuration. This should not be used under "normal" circumstances, but it can be useful, for example, by providing the capability of booting from a floppy disk, without having a floppy in the drive every time you run lilo. This sets the unsafe keyword in lilo. conf.
& Record boot command lines for defaults
Checking this box enables automatic recording of boot command lines as the default for the following bootups. This way, lilo "locks" on a choice until it is manually overridden. This sets the lock option in lilo. conf
Restrict parameters
If this box is checked, a password (entered below) is required only if any parameters are changed (i. e. the user can boot linux, but not linux single or linux init=/ bin/ sh). This sets the restricted option in lilo. conf.
Require & password:
Enter the password required for bootup (if any) here. If restricted above is checked, the password is required for additional parameters only. WARNING: The password is stored in clear text in / etc/ lilo. conf. Make sure that nobody untrusted can read this file. Also, you probably do not want to use your normal/ root password here.

LILO Configuration
(c) 2000, Bernhard Rosenkraenzer
Bernhard "Bero" Rosenkraenzer
Select...
You can edit the lilo. conf file directly here. All changes you make here are automatically transferred to the graphical interface.
Install & boot record to drive/ partition:
Select the drive or partition you want to install the LILO boot loader to here. Unless you intend to use other boot managers in addition to LILO, this should be the MBR (master boot record) of your boot drive. In this case, you should probably select / dev/ hda if your boot drive is an IDE drive or / dev/ sda if your boot drive is SCSI.
Boot the default kernel/ OS & after:
/ 10 seconds
LILO will wait the amount of time specified here before booting the kernel (or OS) marked as default in the Images tab.
Use & linear mode
Check this box if you want to use the linear mode. Linear mode tells the boot loader the location of kernels in linear addressing rather than sector/ head/ cylinder. Linear mode is required for some SCSI drives, and should not cause problems unless you are planning to create a boot disk to be used with a different computer. See the lilo. conf man page for details.
Use & compact mode
Check this box if you want to use the compact mode. The compact mode tries to merge read requests for adjacent sectors into a single read request. This reduces load time and keeps the boot map smaller, but will not work on all systems.
Checking this box enables automatic recording of boot command lines as the defaults for the following boots. This way, lilo "locks" on a choice until it is manually overridden. This sets the lock option in lilo. conf.
If this box is checked, a password (entered below) is required only if any parameters are changed (i. e. the user can boot linux, but not linux single or linux init=/ bin/ sh). This sets the restricted option in lilo. conf. This sets a default for all Linux kernels you want to boot. If you need a per-kernel setting, go to the Operating systems tab and select Details.
Enter the password required for bootup (if any) here. If restricted is checked above, the password is only required for additional parameters. WARNING: The password is stored in clear text in / etc/ lilo. conf. Make sure that nobody untrusted can read this file. Also, you probably do not want to use your normal/ root password here. This sets a default for all Linux kernels you want to boot. If you need a per-kernel setting, go to the Operating systems tab and select Details.
& Default graphics mode on text console:
You can select the default graphics mode here. If you intend to use a VGA graphics mode, you must compile the kernel with support for framebuffer devices. The ask setting brings up a prompt at boot time. This sets a default for all Linux kernels you want to boot. If you need a per-kernel setting, go to the Operating systems tab and select Details.
Enter LILO & prompt automatically
If this box is checked, LILO goes to the LILO prompt whether or not a key is pressed. If it is turned off, LILO boots the default operating system unless shift is pressed (in that case, it goes to the LILO prompt). This sets the prompt option in lilo. conf.
This is the list of kernels and operating systems you can currently boot. Select which one you want to edit here.
& Kernel:
Enter the filename of the kernel you want to boot here.
& Label:
Enter the label (name) of the kernel you want to boot here.
& Root filesystem:
Enter the root filesystem (i. e. the partition that will be mounted as / at boot time) for the kernel you want to boot here.
& Initial ramdisk:
If you want to use an initial ramdisk (initrd) for this kernel, enter its filename here. Leave this field blank if you do not intend to use an initial ramdisk for this kernel.
Extra parameters:
Enter any extra parameters you wish to pass to the kernel here. Usually, this can be left blank. This sets the append option in lilo. conf.

Unmount Tape
KDat will dump your files properly to tape, but may not be able to restore them. To restore your files by hand, you need to know the name of the *non-rewinding* version of your tape device %1.
For example, if your device is / dev/ st0, the non-rewinding version is / dev/ nst0. If your device name does not look like that, type "ls -l %1" in a terminal window to see the real name of your tape drive. Substitute that name for / dev/ nst0 below. Open a terminal window and type the following: tar tfv / dev/ nst0; tar tfv / dev/ nst0 tar xfv / dev/ nst0 The third call to "tar" will retrieve your data into your current directory. Please let us know if this happens to you. - KDat Maintenance Team

Load tape on mount
Issue an mtload command prior to mounting the tape.
This command issues an mtload command to the tape device before trying to mount it. This is required by some tape drives.
Lock tape drive on mount
Disable the eject button after mounting the tape.
This option makes KDat try to disable the eject button on the tape drive after the tape has been mounted. This does n't work for all tape drives.
Eject tape on unmount
Try to eject the tape after it is unmounted. Do not use this for ftape.
Try to eject the tape after it has been unmounted. This option should not be used for floppy-tape drives.
Variable block size
Enable variable-block size support in the tape drive.
Some tape drives support different sizes of the data block. With this option, KDat will attempt to enable that support. You must still specify the block size.

Uses a simple simple motion model to generate many different display modes. The control points attract each other up to a certain distance, and then begin to repel each other.

Repeatedly rotates a bitmap by 90 degrees by using logical operations: the bitmap is divided into quadrants, and the quadrants are shifted clockwise. Then the same thing is done again with progressively smaller quadrants, except that all sub-quadrants of a given size are rotated in parallel. As you watch it, the image appears to dissolve into static and then reconstitute itself, but rotated. Written by Jamie Zawinski; 1992.

Hyperball is to hypercube as dodecahedron is to cube: this displays a 2D projection of the sequence of 3D objects which are the projections of the 4D analog to the dodecahedron. Technically, it is a "120 cell polytope".

To make it easier to visualize the rotation, it uses a different color for the edges of each face. Do n't think about it too long, or your brain will melt. See also "polytopes" for a more general version of this using OpenGL. http: / /en. wikipedia. org/ wiki/ Hypercube http: / /en. wikipedia. org/ wiki/ Regular_polytope Written by Joe Keane, Fritz Mueller, and Jamie Zawinski; 1992.

This generates random cloud-like patterns. The idea is to take four points on the edge of the image, and assign each a random "elevation". Then find the point between them, and give it a value which is the average of the other four, plus some small random offset. Coloration is done based on elevation.

Draws quasiperiodic tilings; think of the implications on modern formica technology. In April 1997, Sir Roger Penrose, a British math professor who has worked with Stephen Hawking on such topics as relativity, black holes, and whether time has a beginning, filed a copyright-infringement lawsuit against the Kimberly-Clark Corporation, which Penrose said copied a pattern he created (a pattern demonstrating that "a nonrepeating pattern could exist in nature") for its Kleenex quilted toilet paper. Penrose said he does n't like litigation but, "When it comes to the population of Great Britain being invited by a multinational to wipe their bottoms on what appears to be the work of a Knight of the Realm, then a last stand must be taken." As reported by News of the Weird #491, 4-Jul-1997. http: / /en. wikipedia. org/ wiki/ Penrose_tiling Written by Timo Korvola; 1997.

This group contains various examples demonstrating most of the features of KHotkeys. (Note that this group and all its actions are disabled by default.)
Examples
After pressing Ctrl+Alt+I, the KSIRC window will be activated, if it exists. Simple.
Activate KSIRC Window
KSIRC window
KSIRC
After pressing Alt+Ctrl+H the input of'Hello 'will be simulated, as if you typed it. This is especially useful if you have call to frequently type a word (for instance, 'unsigned'). Every keypress in the input is separated by a colon ':'. Note that the keypresses literally mean keypresses, so you have to write what you would press on the keyboard. In the table below, the left column shows the input and the right column shows what to type.\\ "enter" (i. e. new line) Enter or Return\ a (i. e. small a) A\ A (i. e. capital a) Shift+A\: (colon) Shift+;\ '' (space) Space
Type'Hello '
This action runs Konsole, after pressing Ctrl+Alt+T.
Run Konsole
Read the comment on the "Type'Hello '" action first.\\ Qt Designer uses Ctrl+F4 for closing windows. In KDE, however, Ctrl+F4 is the shortcut for going to virtual desktop 4, so this shortcut does not work in QT Designer. Further, Qt Designer does not use KDE's standard Ctrl+W for closing the window.\\ This problem can be solved by remapping Ctrl+W to Ctrl+F4 when the active window is Qt Designer. When Qt Designer is active, every time Ctrl+W is pressed, Ctrl+F4 will be sent to Qt Designer instead. In other applications, the effect of Ctrl+W is unchanged.\\ We now need to specify three things: A new shortcut trigger on'Ctrl+W', a new keyboard input action sending Ctrl+F4, and a new condition that the active window is Qt Designer.\ Qt Designer seems to always have title'Qt Designer by Trolltech ', so the condition will check for the active window having that title.
Remap Ctrl+W to Ctrl+F4 in Qt Designer
By pressing Alt+Ctrl+W a D-Bus call will be performed that will show the minicli. You can use any kind of D-Bus call, just like using the command line'qdbus' tool.
Perform D-Bus call'kdesktop KDesktopIface popupExecuteCommand() '
Read the comment on the "Type'Hello '" action first.\\ Just like the "Type'Hello'" action, this one simulates keyboard input, specifically, after pressing Ctrl+Alt+B, it sends B to XMMS (B in XMMS jumps to the next song). The'Send to specific window 'checkbox is checked and a window with its class containing'XMMS_Player' is specified; this will make the input always be sent to this window. This way, you can control XMMS even if, for instance, it is on a different virtual desktop.\\ (Run'xprop 'and click on the XMMS window and search for WM_CLASS to see'XMMS_Player').
Next in XMMS
XMMS window
XMMS Player window
Konqueror in KDE3.1 has tabs, and now you can also have gestures.\\ Just press the middle mouse button and start drawing one of the gestures, and after you are finished, release the mouse button. If you only need to paste the selection, it still works, just click the middle mouse button. (You can change the mouse button to use in the global settings).\\ Right now, there are the following gestures available:\ move right and back left - Forward (Alt+Right)\ move left and back right - Back (Alt+Left)\ move up and back down - Up (Alt+Up)\ circle anticlockwise - Reload (F5)\\ The gesture shapes can be entered by performing them in the configuration dialog. You can also look at your numeric pad to help you: gestures are recognized like a 3x3 grid of fields, numbered 1 to 9.\\ Note that you must perform exactly the gesture to trigger the action. Because of this, it is possible to enter more gestures for the action. You should try to avoid complicated gestures where you change the direction of mouse movement more than once. For instance, 45654 or 74123 are simple to perform, but 1236987 may be already quite difficult.\\ The conditions for all gestures are defined in this group. All these gestures are active only if the active window is Konqueror (class contains'konqueror ').

About Bug Reporting - Help
Information about bug reporting
You can help us improve this software by filing a bug report.
It is safe to close this dialog. If you do not want to, you do not have to file a bug report.
In order to generate a useful bug report we need some information about both the crash and your system. (You may also need to install some debug packages.)
Bug Reporting Assistant Guide
This assistant will guide you through the crash reporting process for the KDE Bug Reports Database Site. All the information you enter on the bug report must be in English, if possible, as KDE is formed internationally.
What do you know about the crash?
In this page you need to describe how much do you know about the desktop and the application state before it crashed.
If you can, describe in as much detail as possible the crash circumstances, and what you were doing when the application crashed (this information is going to be requested later.) You can mention:
actions you were taking inside or outside the application
documents or images that you were using and their type/ format (later if you go to look at the report in the bug tracking system, you can attach a file to the report)
widgets that you were running
the URL of a web site you were browsing
configuration details of the application
or other strange things you notice before or after the crash.
Screenshots can be very helpful sometimes. You can attach them to the bug report after it is posted to the bug tracking system.
Crash Information (backtrace)
This page will generate a "backtrace" of the crash. This is information that tells the developers where the application crashed.
If the crash information is not detailed enough, you may need to install some debug packages and reload it (if the Install Debug Symbols button is available you can use it to automatically install the missing information.)
You can find more information about backtraces, what they mean, and how they are useful at %1
Once you get a useful backtrace (or if you do not want to install the missing debugging packages) you can continue.
Conclusions
Using the quality of the crash information gathered, and your answers on the previous page, the assistant will tell you if the crash is worth reporting or not.
If the crash is worth reporting but the application is not supported in the KDE bug tracking system, you will need to directly contact the maintainer of the application.
If the crash is listed as being not worth reporting, and you think the assistant has made a mistake, you can still manually report the bug by logging into the bug tracking system. You can also go back and change information and download debug packages.
Login into the bug tracking system
We may need to contact you in the future to ask for further information. As we need to keep track of the bug reports, you need to have an account on the KDE bug tracking system. If you do not have one, you can create one here: %1
Then, enter your username and password and press the Login button. You can use this login to directly access the KDE bug tracking system later.
The KWallet dialog may appear when pressing Login to save your password in the KWallet password system. Also, it will prompt you for the KWallet password upon loading to autocomplete the login fields if you use this assistant again.
List of possible duplicate reports
This page will search the bug report database for similar crashes which are possible duplicates of your bug. If there are similar bug reports found, you can double click on them to see details. Then, read the current bug report information so you can check to see if they are similar.
If you are very sure your bug is the same as another that is previously reported, you can set your information to be attached to the existing report.
If you are unsure whether your report is the same, follow the main options to tentatively mark your crash as a duplicate of that report. This is usually the safest thing to do. We cannot uncombine bug reports, but we can easily merge them.
If not enough possible duplicates are found, or you did not find a similar report, then you can force it to search for more bug reports (only if the date range limit is not reached.)
If you do not find any related reports, your crash information is not useful enough, and you really cannot give additional information about the crash context, then it is better to not file the bug report, thereby closing the assistant.
Details of the bug report and your system
In this case you need to write a title and description of the crash. Explain as best you can.
You can also specify your distribution method (GNU/ Linux distribution or packaging system) or if you compiled the KDE Platform from sources.
You should write in English.
Sending the Crash Report
The last page will send the bug report to the bug tracking system and will notify you when it is done. It will then show the web address of the bug report in the KDE bug tracking system, so that you can look at the report later.
If the process fails, you can click Retry to try sending the bug report again. If the report cannot be sent because the bug tracking database has a problem, you can save it to a file to manually report later.
Thank you for being part of KDE!

Unable to create a valid backtrace.
This backtrace appears to be of no use. This is probably because your packages are built in a way which prevents creation of proper backtraces, or the stack frame was seriously corrupted in the crash.
Loading backtrace...
The following options are enabled:
As the usage of these options is not recommended - because they can, in rare cases, be responsible for KDE problems - a backtrace will not be generated. You need to turn these options off and reproduce the problem again in order to get a backtrace.

Do you want to generate a backtrace? This will help the developers to figure out what went wrong. Unfortunately this will take some time on slow machines.

Show file in separate viewer
Here you can configure what the Konqueror file manager will do when you click on a file belonging to this group. Konqueror can display the file in an embedded viewer or start up a separate application. You can change this setting for a specific file type in the'Embedding 'tab of the file type configuration. Dolphin shows files always in a separate viewer
This button displays the icon associated with the selected file type. Click on it to choose a different icon.
This is the icon associated with the selected file type. Choosing a different icon requires shared-mime-info to be at least version 0.40.
Filename Patterns
This box contains a list of patterns that can be used to identify files of the selected type. For example, the pattern *. txt is associated with the file type'text/ plain '; all files ending in'. txt 'are recognized as plain text files.
Add...
Add a new pattern for the selected file type.
Remove
Remove the selected filename pattern.
Description:
You can enter a short description for files of the selected file type (e. g. 'HTML Page '). This description will be used by applications like Konqueror to display directory content.
Ask whether to save to disk instead (only for Konqueror browser)
Here you can configure what the Konqueror file manager will do when you click on a file of this type. Konqueror can either display the file in an embedded viewer, or start up a separate application. If set to'Use settings for G group ', the file manager will behave according to the settings of the group G to which this type belongs; for instance, 'image' if the current file type is image/ png. Dolphin always shows files in a separate viewer.

File Associations This module allows you to choose which applications are associated with a given type of file. File types are also referred to as MIME types (MIME is an acronym which stands for "Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions"). A file association consists of the following: Rules for determining the MIME-type of a file, for example the filename pattern *. png, which means'all files with names that end in. png ', is associated with the MIME type "image/ png"; A short description of the MIME-type, for example the description of the MIME type "image/ png" is simply'PNG image'; An icon to be used for displaying files of the given MIME-type, so that you can easily identify the type of file in a file manager or file-selection dialog (at least for the types you use often); A list of the applications which can be used to open files of the given MIME-type -- if more than one application can be used then the list is ordered by priority. You may be surprised to find that some MIME types have no associated filename patterns; in these cases, KDE is able to determine the MIME-type by directly examining the contents of the file.
Find file type or filename pattern
Enter a part of a filename pattern, and only file types with a matching file pattern will appear in the list. Alternatively, enter a part of a file type name as it appears in the list.
Known Types
Here you can see a hierarchical list of the file types which are known on your system. Click on the '+ 'sign to expand a category, or the '-' sign to collapse it. Select a file type (e. g. text/ html for HTML files) to view/ edit the information for that file type using the controls on the right.

Joystick This module helps to check if your joystick is working correctly. If it delivers wrong values for the axes, you can try to solve this with the calibration. This module tries to find all available joystick devices by checking / dev/ js[0-4] and / dev/ input/ js[0-4] If you have another device file, enter it in the combobox. The Buttons list shows the state of the buttons on your joystick, the Axes list shows the current value for all axes.

Colors This module allows you to choose the color scheme used for the KDE desktop. The different elements of the desktop, such as title bars, menu text, etc., are called "widgets". You can choose the widget whose color you want to change by selecting it from a list, or by clicking on a graphical representation of the desktop. You can save color settings as complete color schemes, which can also be modified or deleted. KDE comes with several predefined color schemes on which you can base your own. All KDE applications will obey the selected color scheme. Non-KDE applications may also obey some or all of the color settings, if this option is enabled.
This is a preview of the color settings which will be applied if you click "Apply" or "OK". You can click on different parts of this preview image. The widget name in the "Widget color" box will change to reflect the part of the preview image you clicked.
This is a list of predefined color schemes, including any that you may have created. You can preview an existing color scheme by selecting it from the list. The current scheme will be replaced by the selected color scheme. Warning: if you have not yet applied any changes you may have made to the current scheme, those changes will be lost if you select another color scheme.
Press this button if you want to save the current color settings as a color scheme. You will be prompted for a name.
Press this button to remove the selected color scheme. Note that this button is disabled if you do not have permission to delete the color scheme.
Press this button to import a new color scheme. Note that the color scheme will only be available for the current user.

Here you can change the component program. Components are programs that handle basic tasks, like the terminal emulator, the text editor and the email client. Different KDE applications sometimes need to invoke a console emulator, send a mail or display some text. To do so consistently, these applications always call the same components. You can choose here which programs these components are.

If you have a TFT or LCD screen you can further improve the quality of displayed fonts by selecting this option. Sub-pixel rendering is also known as ClearType(tm). In order for sub-pixel rendering to work correctly you need to know how the sub-pixels of your display are aligned. On TFT or LCD displays a single pixel is actually composed of three sub-pixels, red, green and blue. Most displays have a linear ordering of RGB sub-pixel, some have BGR. This feature does not work with CRT monitors.

Force fonts DPI:
96 DPI
120 DPI
This option forces a specific DPI value for fonts. It may be useful when the real DPI of the hardware is not detected properly and it is also often misused when poor quality fonts are used that do not look well with DPI values other than 96 or 120 DPI. The use of this option is generally discouraged. For selecting proper DPI value a better option is explicitly configuring it for the whole X server if possible (e. g. DisplaySize in xorg. conf or adding -dpi value to ServerLocalArgs= in $KDEDIR/ share/ config/ kdm/ kdmrc). When fonts do not render properly with real DPI value better fonts should be used or configuration of font hinting should be checked.
Some changes such as anti-aliasing will only affect newly started applications.

Total Memory
This graph gives you an overview of the total sum of physical and virtual memory in your system.
Physical Memory
This graph gives you an overview of the usage of physical memory in your system. Most operating systems (including Linux) will use as much of the available physical memory as possible as disk cache, to speed up the system performance. This means that if you have a small amount of Free Physical Memory and a large amount of Disk Cache Memory, your system is well configured.
Swap Space
The swap space is the virtual memory available to the system. It will be used on demand and is provided through one or more swap partitions and/ or swap files.
Memory Information This display shows you the current memory usage of your system. The values are updated on a regular basis and give you an overview of the physical and virtual used memory.

Mouse This module allows you to choose various options for the way in which your pointing device works. Your pointing device may be a mouse, trackball, or some other hardware that performs a similar function.
& General
If you are left-handed, you may prefer to swap the functions of the left and right buttons on your pointing device by choosing the'left-handed 'option. If your pointing device has more than two buttons, only those that function as the left and right buttons are affected. For example, if you have a three-button mouse, the middle button is unaffected.
The default behavior in KDE is to select and activate icons with a single click of the left button on your pointing device. This behavior is consistent with what you would expect when you click links in most web browsers. If you would prefer to select with a single click, and activate with a double click, check this option.
Activates and opens a file or folder with a single click.
If you check this option, pausing the mouse pointer over an icon on the screen will automatically select that icon. This may be useful when single clicks activate icons, and you want only to select the icon without activating it.
If you have checked the option to automatically select icons, this slider allows you to select how long the mouse pointer must be paused over the icon before it is selected.
& Cursor Theme
Advanced
Pointer acceleration:
This option allows you to change the relationship between the distance that the mouse pointer moves on the screen and the relative movement of the physical device itself (which may be a mouse, trackball, or some other pointing device.) A high value for the acceleration will lead to large movements of the mouse pointer on the screen even when you only make a small movement with the physical device. Selecting very high values may result in the mouse pointer flying across the screen, making it hard to control.
Pointer threshold:
The threshold is the smallest distance that the mouse pointer must move on the screen before acceleration has any effect. If the movement is smaller than the threshold, the mouse pointer moves as if the acceleration was set to 1X; thus, when you make small movements with the physical device, there is no acceleration at all, giving you a greater degree of control over the mouse pointer. With larger movements of the physical device, you can move the mouse pointer rapidly to different areas on the screen.
msec
Double click interval:
The double click interval is the maximal time (in milliseconds) between two mouse clicks which turns them into a double click. If the second click happens later than this time interval after the first click, they are recognized as two separate clicks.
Drag start time:
If you click with the mouse (e. g. in a multi-line editor) and begin to move the mouse within the drag start time, a drag operation will be initiated.
Drag start distance:
If you click with the mouse and begin to move the mouse at least the drag start distance, a drag operation will be initiated.
Mouse wheel scrolls by:
If you use the wheel of a mouse, this value determines the number of lines to scroll for each wheel movement. Note that if this number exceeds the number of visible lines, it will be ignored and the wheel movement will be handled as a page up/ down movement.

Service Manager This module allows you to have an overview of all plugins of the KDE Daemon, also referred to as KDE Services. Generally, there are two types of service: Services invoked at startup Services called on demand The latter are only listed for convenience. The startup services can be started and stopped. In Administrator mode, you can also define whether services should be loaded at startup. Use this with care: some services are vital for KDE; do not deactivate services if you do not know what you are doing.

Cache This module lets you configure your cache settings. The cache is an internal memory in Konqueror where recently read web pages are stored. If you want to retrieve a web page again that you have recently read, it will not be downloaded from the Internet, but rather retrieved from the cache, which is a lot faster.

Cookies Cookies contain information that Konqueror (or other KDE applications using the HTTP protocol) stores on your computer, initiated by a remote Internet server. This means that a web server can store information about you and your browsing activities on your machine for later use. You might consider this an invasion of privacy. However, cookies are useful in certain situations. For example, they are often used by Internet shops, so you can'put things into a shopping basket '. Some sites require you have a browser that supports cookies. Because most people want a compromise between privacy and the benefits cookies offer, KDE offers you the ability to customize the way it handles cookies. So you might want to set KDE's default policy to ask you whenever a server wants to set a cookie, allowing you to decide. For your favorite shopping web sites that you trust, you might want to set the policy to accept, then you can access the web sites without being prompted every time KDE receives a cookie.

Cookies Cookies contain information that Konqueror (or any other KDE application using the HTTP protocol) stores on your computer from a remote Internet server. This means that a web server can store information about you and your browsing activities on your machine for later use. You might consider this an invasion of privacy. However, cookies are useful in certain situations. For example, they are often used by Internet shops, so you can'put things into a shopping basket '. Some sites require you have a browser that supports cookies. Because most people want a compromise between privacy and the benefits cookies offer, KDE offers you the ability to customize the way it handles cookies. You might, for example want to set KDE's default policy to ask you whenever a server wants to set a cookie or simply reject or accept everything. For example, you might choose to accept all cookies from your favorite shopping web site. For this all you have to do is either browse to that particular site and when you are presented with the cookie dialog box, click on This domain under the'apply to' tab and choose accept or simply specify the name of the site in the Domain Specific Policy tab and set it to accept. This enables you to receive cookies from trusted web sites without being asked every time KDE receives a cookie.

Proxy A proxy server is an intermediate program that sits between your machine and the Internet and provides services such as web page caching and/ or filtering. Caching proxy servers give you faster access to sites you have already visited by locally storing or caching the content of those pages; filtering proxy servers, on the other hand, provide the ability to block out requests for ads, spam, or anything else you want to block. Note: Some proxy servers provide both services.

Reject the so called third-party cookies. These are cookies that originate from a site other than the one you are currently browsing. For example, if you visit www. foobar. com while this option is on, only cookies that originate from www. foobar. com will be processed per your settings. Cookies from any other site will be rejected. This reduces the chances of site operators compiling a profile about your daily browsing habits.

Automatically accept temporary cookies meant to expire at the end of the current session. Such cookies will not be stored in your computer's hard drive or storage device. Instead, they are deleted when you close all applications (e. g. your browser) that use them. NOTE: Checking this option along with the next one will override your default as well as site specific cookie policies. However, doing so also increases your privacy since all cookies will be removed when the current session ends.
Automatically accept session cookies
Treat all cookies as session cookies. Session cookies are small pieces of data that are temporarily stored in your computer's memory until you quit or close all applications (e. g. your browser) that use them. Unlike regular cookies, session cookies are never stored on your hard drive or other storage medium. NOTE: Checking this option along with the previous one will override your default as well as site specific cookie policies. However, doing so also increases your privacy since all cookies will be removed when the current session ends.

Windows Shares Konqueror is able to access shared Microsoft Windows file systems, if properly configured. If there is a specific computer from which you want to browse, fill in the Browse server field. This is mandatory if you are not running Samba locally. The Broadcast address and WINS address fields will also be available, if you use the native code, or the location of the'smb. conf 'file from which the options are read, when using Samba. In any case, the broadcast address (interfaces in smb. conf) must be set up if it is guessed incorrectly or you have multiple cards. A WINS server usually improves performance, and reduces the network load a lot. The bindings are used to assign a default user for a given server, possibly with the corresponding password, or for accessing specific shares. If you choose to, new bindings will be created for logins and shares accessed during browsing. You can edit all of them from here. Passwords will be stored locally, and scrambled so as to render them unreadable to the human eye. For security reasons, you may not want to do that, as entries with passwords are clearly indicated as such.

Duplicate Identification
Browser Identification The browser-identification module allows you to have full control over how Konqueror will identify itself to web sites you browse. This ability to fake identification is necessary because some web sites do not display properly when they detect that they are not talking to current versions of either Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer, even if the browser actually supports all the necessary features to render those pages properly. For such sites, you can use this feature to try to browse them. Please understand that this might not always work, since such sites might be using non-standard web protocols and or specifications. NOTE: To obtain specific help on a particular section of the dialog box, simply click on the quick help button on the window title bar, then click on the section for which you are seeking help.
Local Network Browsing Here you setup your "Network Neighborhood". You can use either the LISa daemon and the lan: / ioslave, or the ResLISa daemon and the rlan: / ioslave. About the LAN ioslave configuration: If you select it, the ioslave, if available, will check whether the host supports this service when you open this host. Please note that paranoid people might consider even this to be an attack. Always means that you will always see the links for the services, regardless of whether they are actually offered by the host. Never means that you will never have the links to the services. In both cases you will not contact the host, so nobody will ever regard you as an attacker. More information about LISa can be found at the LISa Homepage or contact Alexander Neundorf & lt; neundorf@kde. org gt;.

If this option is checked, Konqueror will open a new window when you open a folder, rather than showing that folder's contents in the current window.
Show'Delete 'context menu entries which bypass the trashcan
Check this if you want'Delete 'menu commands to be displayed on the desktop and in the file manager's context menus. You can always delete files by holding the Shift key while calling'Move to Trash'.
Paths This module allows you to choose where in the filesystem the files on your desktop should be stored. Use the "Whats This?" (Shift+F1) to get help on specific options.
Desktop path:
This folder contains all the files which you see on your desktop. You can change the location of this folder if you want to, and the contents will move automatically to the new location as well.

& Behavior
& Previews & & Meta-Data
Allow previews, "Folder Icons Reflect Contents", and retrieval of meta-data on protocols:
Preview Options Here you can modify the behavior of Konqueror when it shows the files in a folder. The list of protocols: check the protocols over which previews should be shown; uncheck those over which they should not. For instance, you might want to show previews over SMB if the local network is fast enough, but you might disable it for FTP if you often visit very slow FTP sites with large images. Maximum File Size: select the maximum file size for which previews should be generated. For instance, if set to 1 MB (the default), no preview will be generated for files bigger than 1 MB, for speed reasons.

To change an existing policy, click on the Change... button and choose the new policy from the policy dialog box. Clicking on the Delete button will remove the selected policy, causing the default policy setting to be used for that domain.
Enabling the security manager will cause the jvm to run with a Security Manager in place. This will keep applets from being able to read and write to your file system, creating arbitrary sockets, and other actions which could be used to compromise your system. Disable this option at your own risk. You can modify your $HOME/. java. policy file with the Java policytool utility to give code downloaded from certain sites more permissions.
Enabling this will cause the jvm to use KIO for network transport
Enter the path to the java executable. If you want to use the jre in your path, simply leave it as'java '. If you need to use a different jre, enter the path to the java executable (e. g. / usr/ lib/ jdk/ bin/ java), or the path to the directory that contains'bin/ java' (e. g. / opt/ IBMJava2-13).
If you want special arguments to be passed to the virtual machine, enter them here.
When all the applets have been destroyed, the applet server should shut down. However, starting the jvm takes a lot of time. If you would like to keep the java process running while you are browsing, you can set the timeout value to whatever you like. To keep the java process running for the whole time that the konqueror process is, leave the Shutdown Applet Server checkbox unchecked.

You can either specify options or apply your own self-written stylesheet by pointing to its location. Note that these settings will always have precedence before all other settings made by the site author. This can be useful to visually impaired people or for web pages that are unreadable due to bad design.

Enhanced Browsing In this module you can configure some enhanced browsing features of KDE. Web Shortcuts Web Shortcuts are a quick way of using Web search engines. For example, type "altavista: frobozz" or "av: frobozz" and Konqueror will do a search on AltaVista for "frobozz". Even easier: just press Alt+F2 (if you have not changed this shortcut) and enter the shortcut in the KDE Run Command dialog.

Search & URI:
Enter the URI that is used to do a search on the search engine here. The whole text to be searched for can be specified as \\{@} or \\{0}. Recommended is \\{@}, since it removes all query variables (name=value) from the resulting string whereas \\{0} will be substituted with the unmodified query string. You can use \\{1}... \\{n} to specify certain words from the query and \\{name} to specify a value given by'name=value 'in the user query. In addition it is possible to specify multiple references (names, numbers and strings) at once (\\{name1, name2,..., "string"}). The first matching value (from the left) will be used as substitution value for the resulting URI. A quoted string can be used as default value if nothing matches from the left of the reference list.
Search & provider name:
The shortcuts entered here can be used as a pseudo-URI scheme in KDE. For example, the shortcut av can be used as in av: my search
URI shortcuts:
Select the character set that will be used to encode your search query.
In this module you can configure the web shortcuts feature. Web shortcuts allow you to quickly search or lookup words on the Internet. For example, to search for information about the KDE project using the Google engine, you simply type gg: KDE or google: KDE. If you select a default search engine, normal words or phrases will be looked up at the specified search engine by simply typing them into applications, such as Konqueror, that have built-in support for such a feature.

Title:
Extra role:
Machine:
For selecting all windows belonging to a specific application, selecting only window class should usually work.
Use window & class (whole application)
For selecting a specific window in an application, both window class and window role should be selected. Window class will determine the application, and window role the specific window in the application; many applications do not provide useful window roles though.
Use window class and window & role (specific window)
With some (non-KDE) applications whole window class can be sufficient for selecting a specific window in an application, as they set whole window class to contain both application and window role.
Use & whole window class (specific window)
Match also window & title
A single shortcut can be easily assigned or cleared using the two buttons. Only shortcuts with modifiers can be used. It is possible to have several possible shortcuts, and the first available shortcut will be used. The shortcuts are specified using space-separated shortcut sets. One set is specified as base+(list), where base are modifiers and list is a list of keys. For example "Shift+Alt+(123) Shift+Ctrl+(ABC)" will first try Shift+Alt+1, then others with Shift+Ctrl+C as the last one.

Specify how the window property should be affected: Do Not Affect: The window property will not be affected and therefore the default handling for it will be used. Specifying this will block more generic window settings from taking effect. Apply Initially: The window property will be only set to the given value after the window is created. No further changes will be affected. Remember: The value of the window property will be remembered and every time time the window is created, the last remembered value will be applied. Force: The window property will be always forced to the given value. Apply Now: The window property will be set to the given value immediately and will not be affected later (this action will be deleted afterwards). Force temporarily: The window property will be forced to the given value until it is hidden (this action will be deleted after the window is hidden).

Extreme
This option specifies how much KWin will try to prevent unwanted focus stealing caused by unexpected activation of new windows. (Note: This feature does not work with the Focus Under Mouse or Focus Strictly Under Mouse focus policies.) None: Prevention is turned off and new windows always become activated. Low: Prevention is enabled; when some window does not have support for the underlying mechanism and KWin cannot reliably decide whether to activate the window or not, it will be activated. This setting may have both worse and better results than the medium level, depending on the applications. Medium: Prevention is enabled. High: New windows get activated only if no window is currently active or if they belong to the currently active application. This setting is probably not really usable when not using mouse focus policy. Extreme: All windows must be explicitly activated by the user. Windows that are prevented from stealing focus are marked as demanding attention, which by default means their taskbar entry will be highlighted. This can be changed in the Notifications control module.
Focus stealing prevention level:
Click to Focus
Focus Follows Mouse
Focus Under Mouse
Focus Strictly Under Mouse
& Policy:
The focus policy is used to determine the active window, i. e. the window you can work in. Click to focus: A window becomes active when you click into it. This is the behavior you might know from other operating systems. Focus follows mouse: Moving the mouse pointer actively on to a normal window activates it. New windows will receive the focus, without you having to point the mouse at them explicitly. Very practical if you are using the mouse a lot. Focus under mouse: The window that happens to be under the mouse pointer is active. If the mouse points nowhere, the last window that was under the mouse has focus. New windows will not automatically receive the focus. Focus strictly under mouse: Only the window under the mouse pointer is active. If the mouse points nowhere, nothing has focus. Note that'Focus under mouse 'and'Focus strictly under mouse' prevent certain features such as the Alt+Tab walk through windows dialog in the KDE mode from working properly.
ms
Delay focus by:
Click raises active window
When this option is enabled, a window in the background will automatically come to the front when the mouse pointer has been over it for some time.
This is the delay after which the window that the mouse pointer is over will automatically come to the front.
When this option is enabled, the active window will be brought to the front when you click somewhere into the window contents. To change it for inactive windows, you need to change the settings in the Actions tab.
When this option is enabled, there will be a delay after which the window the mouse pointer is over will become active (receive focus).
This is the delay after which the window the mouse pointer is over will automatically receive focus.
Separate screen focus
When this option is enabled, focus operations are limited only to the active Xinerama screen
When this option is enabled, the active Xinerama screen (where new windows appear, for example) is the screen containing the mouse pointer. When disabled, the active Xinerama screen is the screen containing the focused window. By default this option is disabled for Click to focus and enabled for other focus policies.
Shading
& Enable hover
If Shade Hover is enabled, a shaded window will un-shade automatically when the mouse pointer has been over the title bar for some time.
Sets the time in milliseconds before the window unshades when the mouse pointer goes over the shaded window.

It might be useful to selectively affect placement of some windows using the window-specific settings. Cascade will cascade the windows Random will use a random position Centered will place the window centered Zero-Cornered will place the window in the top-left corner

Hide utility windows for inactive applications
When turned on, utility windows (tool windows, torn-off menus,...) of inactive applications will be hidden and will be shown only when the application becomes active. Note that applications have to mark the windows with the proper window type for this feature to work.

With this option activated, only one instance of Konqueror used for file browsing will exist in the memory of your computer at any moment, no matter how many file browsing windows you open, thus reducing resource requirements. Be aware that this also means that, if something goes wrong, all your file browsing windows will be closed simultaneously
With this option activated, only one instance of Konqueror will exist in the memory of your computer at any moment, no matter how many browsing windows you open, thus reducing resource requirements. Be aware that this also means that, if something goes wrong, all your browsing windows will be closed simultaneously.
If non-zero, this option allows keeping Konqueror instances in memory after all their windows have been closed, up to the number specified in this option. When a new Konqueror instance is needed, one of these preloaded instances will be reused instead, improving responsiveness at the expense of the memory required by the preloaded instances.
If enabled, an instance of Konqueror will be preloaded after the ordinary KDE startup sequence. This will make the first Konqueror window open faster, but at the expense of longer KDE startup times (but you will be able to work while it is loading, so you may not even notice that it is taking longer).
If enabled, KDE will always try to have one preloaded Konqueror instance ready; preloading a new instance in the background whenever there is not one available, so that windows will always open quickly. Warning: In some cases, it is actually possible that this will reduce perceived performance.

System Configuration
Disable & system configuration startup check
This option may in rare cases lead to various problems. Consult the What's This (Shift+F1) help for details.
During startup KDE needs to perform a check of its system configuration (mimetypes, installed applications, etc.), and in case the configuration has changed since the last time, the system configuration cache (KSyCoCa) needs to be updated. This option delays the check, which avoid scanning all directories containing files describing the system during KDE startup, thus making KDE startup faster. However, in the rare case the system configuration has changed since the last time, and the change is needed before this delayed check takes place, this option may lead to various problems (missing applications in the K Menu, reports from applications about missing required mimetypes, etc.). Changes of system configuration mostly happen by (un)installing applications. It is therefore recommended to turn this option temporarily off while (un)installing applications.

& Statistics
The Samba and NFS Status Monitor is a front end to the programs smbstatus and showmount. Smbstatus reports on current Samba connections, and is part of the suite of Samba tools, which implements the SMB (Session Message Block) protocol, also called the NetBIOS or LanManager protocol. This protocol can be used to provide printer sharing or drive sharing services on a network including machines running the various flavors of Microsoft Windows.

Screen Saver This module allows you to enable and configure a screen saver. Note that you can enable a screen saver even if you have power saving features enabled for your display. Besides providing an endless variety of entertainment and preventing monitor burn-in, a screen saver also gives you a simple way to lock your display if you are going to leave it unattended for a while. If you want the screen saver to lock the session, make sure you enable the "Require password" feature of the screen saver; if you do not, you can still explicitly lock the session using the desktop's "Lock Session" action.

Unable to contact the KDE smartcard service.
Possible Reasons
1) The KDE daemon, 'kded 'is not running. You can restart it by running the command'kdeinit' and then try reloading the KDE System Settings to see if this message goes away. 2) You do not appear to have smartcard support in the KDE libraries. You will need to recompile the kdelibs package with libpcsclite installed.
Smartcard Support
& Enable smartcard support
Enable & polling to autodetect card events
In most cases you should have this enabled. It allows KDE to automatically detect card insertion and reader hotplug events.
Automatically & launch card manager if inserted card is unclaimed
When you insert a smartcard, KDE can automatically launch a management tool if no other application attempts to use the card.

When enabled, all popup menus will have a drop-shadow, otherwise drop-shadows will not be displayed. At present, only KDE styles can have this effect enabled.
Software Tint: Alpha-blend using a flat color. Software Blend: Alpha-blend using an image. XRender Blend: Use the XFree RENDER extension for image blending (if available). This method may be slower than the Software routines on non-accelerated displays, but may however improve performance on remote displays.
By adjusting this slider you can control the menu effect opacity.
Note: that all widgets in this combobox do not apply to Qt-only applications.
If you check this box, the toolbars will be transparent when moving them around.
If you enable this option some pop-up menus will show so called tear-off handles. If you click them, you get the menu inside a widget. This can be very helpful when performing the same action multiple times.

Select the user to be preselected for login. This box is editable, so you can specify an arbitrary non-existent user to mislead possible attackers.
Focus password
When this option is on, KDM will place the cursor in the password field instead of the user field after preselecting a user. Use this to save one key press per login, if the preselection usually does not need to be changed.
Enable Password-Less Logins
When this option is checked, the checked users from the list below will be allowed to log in without entering their password. This applies only to KDM's graphical login. Think twice before enabling this!

Login Manager In this module you can configure the various aspects of the KDE Login Manager. This includes the look and feel as well as the users that can be selected for login. Note that you can only make changes if you run the module with superuser rights. If you have not started the KDE System Settings with superuser rights (which is absolutely the right thing to do, by the way), click on the Modify button to acquire superuser rights. You will be asked for the superuser password. General On this tab page, you can configure parts of the Login Manager's look, and which language it should use. The language settings made here have no influence on the user's language settings. Dialog Here you can configure the look of the "classical" dialog based mode if you have chosen to use it. Background If you want to set a special background for the dialog based login screen, this is where to do it. Themes Here you can specify a theme to be used by the Login Manager. Shutdown Here you can specify who is allowed to shutdown/ reboot the machine and whether a boot manager should be used. Users On this tab page, you can select which users the Login Manager will offer you for logging in. Convenience Here you can specify a user to be logged in automatically, users not needing to provide a password to log in, and other convenience features. Note, that these settings are security holes by their nature, so use them very carefully.
& General
& Dialog
There is no login dialog window in themed mode.
& Background

& Convenience
Drag the anchor to move the center of the dialog to the desired position. Keyboard control is possible as well: Use the arrow keys or Home to center. Note that the actual proportions of the dialog are probably different.

Command (see --commands)
Arguments for command
Syntax:
kfmclient openURL'url '['mimetype'] # Opens a window showing'url '. # 'url' may be a relative path # or file name, such as. or subdir/ # If'url 'is omitted, $HOME is used instead.
# If'mimetype 'is specified, it will be used to determine the # component that Konqueror should use. For instance, set it to # text/ html for a web page, to make it appear faster
kfmclient newTab'url '['mimetype'] # Same as above but opens a new tab with'url 'in an existing Konqueror # window on the current active desktop if possible.
kfmclient openProfile'profile '['url'] # Opens a window using the given profile. # 'profile 'is a file under ~/. kde/ share/ apps/ konqueror/ profiles. # 'url' is an optional URL to open.
Profile %1 not found
Syntax Error: Not enough arguments
Syntax Error: Too many arguments
Syntax Error: Unknown command '%1 '
kfmclient openProperties'url '# Opens a properties menu
kfmclient exec ['url '['binding']] # Tries to execute'url '. 'url' may be a usual # URL, this URL will be opened. You may omit # 'binding '. In this case the default binding
# is tried. Of course URL may be the URL of a # document, or it may be a *. desktop file.
# This way you could for example mount a device # by passing'Mount default 'as binding to # 'cdrom. desktop'
kfmclient move'src ''dest' # Moves the URL'src 'to'dest'. # 'src 'may be a list of URLs.
kfmclient download ['src '] # Copies the URL'src' to a user specified location '. # 'src' may be a list of URLs, if not present then # a URL will be requested.
kfmclient copy'src ''dest' # Copies the URL'src 'to'dest'. # 'src 'may be a list of URLs.
kfmclient sortDesktop # Rearranges all icons on the desktop.
kfmclient configure # Re-read Konqueror's configuration.
kfmclient configureDesktop # Re-read kdesktop's configuration.
*** Examples: kfmclient exec file: / root/ Desktop/ cdrom. desktop "Mount default" / / Mounts the CD-ROM
kfmclient exec file: / home/ weis/ data/ test. html / / Opens the file with default binding
kfmclient exec file: / home/ weis/ data/ test. html Netscape / / Opens the file with netscape
kfmclient exec ftp: / /localhost/ / / Opens new window with URL
kfmclient exec file: / root/ Desktop/ emacs. desktop / / Starts emacs
kfmclient exec file: / root/ Desktop/ cdrom. desktop / / Opens the CD-ROM's mount directory
kfmclient exec. / / Opens the current directory. Very convenient.

Output:
Modern applications use a system called "FontConfig" to obtain the list of fonts. Older applications, such as OpenOffice 1. x, GIMP 1. x, etc. use the previous "core X fonts" mechanism for this. Selecting this option will inform the installer to create the necessary files so that these older applications can use the fonts you install. Please note, however, that this will slow down the installation process.

You have enabled a previously disabled option. Would you like the config files updated now? (Normally they are only updated upon installing, or removing, a font.)

Clipboard/ Selection Behavior
Separate clipboard and selection
This option prevents the selection being recorded in the clipboard history. Only explicit clipboard changes are recorded.
There are two different clipboard buffers available: Clipboard is filled by selecting something and pressing Ctrl+C, or by clicking "Copy" in a toolbar or menubar. Selection is available immediately after selecting some text. The only way to access the selection is to press the middle mouse button. You can configure the relationship between Clipboard and Selection.
Klipper - clipboard tool
Action list (right click to add/ remove commands):
Double-click here to set the command to be executed
Double-click here to set the regular expression
Selecting this option synchronizes these two buffers.
Using this option will only set the selection when highlighting something and the clipboard when choosing e. g. "Copy" in a menubar.

Search the Web
Konqueror makes working with and managing your files easy. You can browse both local and networked folders while enjoying advanced features such as the powerful sidebar and file previews.
Konqueror is also a full featured and easy to use web browser which you can use to explore the Internet. Enter the address (e. g. http: / /www. kde. org) of a web page you would like to visit in the location bar and press Enter, or choose an entry from the Bookmarks menu.
To return to the previous location, press the back button in the toolbar.
To quickly go to your Home folder press the home button.
For more detailed documentation on Konqueror click here.
Tuning Tip: If you want the Konqueror web browser to start faster, you can turn off this information screen by clicking here. You can re-enable it by choosing the Help - > Konqueror Introduction menu option, and then pressing Settings - > Save View Profile As... - > "Web Browsing".
Next: Tips & Tricks
Konqueror is designed to embrace and support Internet standards. The aim is to fully implement the officially sanctioned standards from organizations such as the W3 and OASIS, while also adding extra support for other common usability features that arise as de facto standards across the Internet. Along with this support, for such functions as favicons, Web Shortcuts, and XBEL bookmarks, Konqueror also implements:

Tips & Tricks
Use Web-Shortcuts: by typing "gg: KDE" one can search the Internet, using Google, for the search phrase "KDE". There are a lot of Web-Shortcuts predefined to make searching for software or looking up certain words in an encyclopedia a breeze. You can even create your own Web-Shortcuts.
Use the magnifier button in the toolbar to increase the font size on your web page.
When you want to paste a new address into the Location toolbar you might want to clear the current entry by pressing the black arrow with the white cross in the toolbar.
To create a link on your desktop pointing to the current page, simply drag the "Location" label that is to the left of the Location toolbar, drop it on to the desktop, and choose "Link".
You can also find "Full-Screen Mode" in the Settings menu. This feature is very useful for "Talk" sessions.
Divide et impera (lat. "Divide and conquer") - by splitting a window into two parts (e. g. Window - > Split View Left/ Right) you can make Konqueror appear the way you like. You can even load some example view-profiles (e. g. Midnight Commander), or create your own ones.
Use the user-agent feature if the website you are visiting asks you to use a different browser (and do not forget to send a complaint to the webmaster!)
The History in your SideBar ensures that you can keep track of the pages you have visited recently.
Use a caching proxy to speed up your Internet connection.
Advanced users will appreciate the Konsole which you can embed into Konqueror (Settings - > Show Terminal Emulator).

This is the URL of the web page where Konqueror (as web browser) will jump to when the \\"Home\\ "button is pressed. When Konqueror is started as a file manager, that button makes it jump to your local home folder instead.

Open folders in separate windows
If this option is checked, Konqueror will open a new window when you open a folder, rather than showing that folder's contents in the current window.

Here you can control if, when moving the mouse over a file, you want to see a small popup window with additional information about that file

Show'Delete 'menu entries which bypass the trashcan
Uncheck this if you do not want'Delete 'menu commands to be displayed on the desktop and in the file manager's menus and context menus. You can still delete files when hidden by holding the Shift key while calling'Move to Trash'.
Standard font
This is the font used to display text in Konqueror windows.
Ask confirmation for deleting a file.
This option tells Konqueror whether to ask for a confirmation when you delete a file without using the trash folder. Warning, deleted files can not be recovered, so it is recommended to leave this confirmation enabled.
Ask confirmation for move to trash
This option tells Konqueror whether to ask for a confirmation when you move the file to your trash folder, from where it can be recovered very easily.

Keyboard Layout Here you can choose your keyboard layout and model. The'model 'refers to the type of keyboard that is connected to your computer, while the keyboard layout defines "which key does what" and may be different for different countries.
Keyboard & model:
Here you can choose a keyboard model. This setting is independent of your keyboard layout and refers to the "hardware" model, i. e. the way your keyboard is manufactured. Modern keyboards that come with your computer usually have two extra keys and are referred to as "104-key" models, which is probably what you want if you do not know what kind of keyboard you have.
Available layouts:
Active layouts:
Command:
Layout variant:
Here you can choose a variant of selected keyboard layout. Layout variants usually represent different key maps for the same language. For example, Ukrainian layout might have four variants: basic, winkeys (as in Windows), typewriter (as in typewriters) and phonetic (each Ukrainian letter is placed on a transliterated latin one).

This is the command which is executed when switching to the selected layout. It may help you if you want to debug layout switching, or if you want to switch layouts without the help of KDE.
Sticky Switching
If you have more than two layouts and turn this option on, switching with the keyboard shortcut or clicking on the kxkb indicator will only cycle through the last few layouts. You can specify the number of layouts to rotate below. You can still access all layouts by right-clicking on the kxkb indicator.

If more than one layout is present in this list, the KDE panel will offer a docked flag. By clicking on this flag you can easily switch between layouts. The first layout will be default one.
Keymap
If you check this option, pressing and holding down a key emits the same character over and over again. For example, pressing and holding down the Tab key will have the same effect as that of pressing that key several times in succession: Tab characters continue to be emitted until you release the key.
& Enable keyboard repeat
& Delay:
If supported, this option allows you to set the delay after which a pressed key will start generating keycodes. The'Repeat rate 'option controls the frequency of these keycodes.
& Rate:
If supported, this option allows you to set the rate at which keycodes are generated while a key is pressed.
If supported, this option allows you to setup the state of NumLock after KDE startup. You can configure NumLock to be turned on or off, or configure KDE not to set NumLock state.

If supported, this option allows you to hear audible clicks from your computer's speakers when you press the keys on your keyboard. This might be useful if your keyboard does not have mechanical keys, or if the sound that the keys make is very soft. You can change the loudness of the key click feedback by dragging the slider button or by clicking the up/ down arrows on the spin box. Setting the volume to 0% turns off the key click.

Killbots
Classic
The rules used in the original BSD command line version of robots. Nothing fancy, just the basic game elements: no fastbots, no safe teleports, no pushing junkheaps, and a huge game grid. Due to its larger width, it is recommended that you use a theme with narrower tiles to better fit your screen.
Daleks
An approximation of the rules used in Daleks, a robots-like game for early Apple computers. The hero is allotted one energy each round that can be used to power the sonic screwdriver. All other special features are disabled.
The default Killbots game type. Includes a medium size grid, safe teleports, fast enemies and pushable junkheaps.
Easy
An easier version of the "Killbots" game type. Includes a bigger game grid prepopulated with junkheaps, a starting stash of energy and an increasing energy cap.
Energy Crisis
The player starts with 30 energy and cannot earn more. How many rounds can you survive and how many points can you collect before your energy and luck run out?

Tutorial Course
Welcome to the tutorial course for Kolf!
To hit the ball, press and hold the Down Arrow or left mouse button. How long you hold down the mouse button or key determines strength of the shot.
To aim the putter, press the Left (rotate counterclockwise) and Right (rotate clockwise) Arrow keys or use the mouse.
Bridges Bridges can have walls on the top, bottom, left, or right.
Everything Here's a hole that has it all. Have fun with Kolf! -- Jason Katz-Brown
Slopes Slopes are slanted areas of ground that push the ball in the direction that they slope. This direction is shown when you choose Hole- > Show Info.
Hit the ball onto the slope and let it roll into cup.
Try out these different types of slopes.
The steepness of a slope is shown when you choose Hole- > Show Info. Steepness goes from 8 (steepest) to 1 (shallowest).
Walls Bounce the ball off of the red walls.
Sand Sand is yellow, and slows your ball down.
Puddles (Water) Hitting into a puddle (blue) adds a penalty stroke to your score, and your ball is placed outside the puddle.
Windmills Windmills (brown base with moving arm) have brown walls (or half walls). The speed of the windmill arm may vary for each hole.
Black Holes Black Holes transport the ball to their exit, and eject it at a speed in direct relation to the speed your ball was traveling. Choose Hole- > Show Info to see which Black Hole goes to which exit and the direction the ball will come out.
Floaters Floaters are moving platforms that carry a ball that lands on it. Floaters' speeds vary.

About KDE
KDE - Be Free! Platform Version %1
KDEis a world-wide network of software engineers, artists, writers, translators and facilitators who are committed to Free Softwaredevelopment. This community has created hundreds of Free Software applications as part of the KDE Development Platform and KDE Software Distribution. KDE is a cooperative enterprise in which no single entity controls the efforts or products of KDE to the exclusion of others. Everyone is welcome to join and contribute to KDE, including you. Visit http://www.kde.orgfor more information about the KDE community and the software we produce.
Software can always be improved, and the KDE team isready to do so. However, you - the user - must tell us when something does not work as expected or could be done better. KDE has a bug tracking system. Visit http://bugs.kde.orgor use the "Report Bug..." dialog from the "Help" menu to report bugs. If you have a suggestion for improvement then you are welcome to use the bug tracking system to register your wish. Make sure you use the severity called "Wishlist".
You do not have to be a software developer to be a member of the KDE team. You can join the national teams that translate program interfaces. You can provide graphics, themes, sounds, and improved documentation. You decide! Visit http://www.kde.org/jobs/for information on some projects in which you can participate. If you need more information or documentation, then a visit to http://techbase.kde.orgwill provide you with what you need.
KDE is available free of charge, but costs are incurred and assets formed in its creation. Thus, the KDE community formed KDE e.V., a non-profit organization legally founded in Tuebingen, Germany. KDE e.V. represents the KDE community in legal and financial matters. See http://www.kde-ev.orgfor information on KDE e.V. KDE benefits from financial support. Most of the funds raised are used to reimburse members and others for expenses they incur when contributing to KDE. You are encouraged to support KDE through a financial donation, using one of the ways described at http://www.kde.org/support/. Thank you very much in advance for your support.

The program which provides compatibility with this protocol may not have been updated with your last update of KDE. This can cause the program to be incompatible with the current version and thus not start.
Internal Error
The program on your computer which provides access to the %1 protocol has reported an internal error.
Improperly Formatted URL
The U niform R esource L ocator (URL) that you entered was not properly formatted. The format of a URL is generally as follows: protocol: / /user: password@www. example. org: port/ folder/ filename. extension? query=value
Unsupported Protocol %1
The protocol %1 is not supported by the KDE programs currently installed on this computer.
The requested protocol may not be supported.
The versions of the %1 protocol supported by this computer and the server may be incompatible.
You may perform a search on the Internet for a KDE program (called a kioslave or ioslave) which supports this protocol. Places to search include http: / /kde-apps. org/ and http: / /freshmeat. net/.
URL Does Not Refer to a Resource.
Protocol is a Filter Protocol
The U niform R esource L ocator (URL) that you entered did not refer to a specific resource.
KDE is able to communicate through a protocol within a protocol; the protocol specified is only for use in such situations, however this is not one of these situations. This is a rare event, and is likely to indicate a programming error.
Unsupported Action: %1
The requested action is not supported by the KDE program which is implementing the %1 protocol.
This error is very much dependent on the KDE program. The additional information should give you more information than is available to the KDE input/ output architecture.
Attempt to find another way to accomplish the same outcome.
File Expected
The request expected a file, however the folder %1 was found instead.
This may be an error on the server side.
Folder Expected
The request expected a folder, however the file %1 was found instead.
File or Folder Does Not Exist
The specified file or folder %1 does not exist.
The requested file could not be created because a file with the same name already exists.
Try moving the current file out of the way first, and then try again.
Delete the current file and try again.
Choose an alternate filename for the new file.
The requested folder could not be created because a folder with the same name already exists.
Try moving the current folder out of the way first, and then try again.
Delete the current folder and try again.
Choose an alternate name for the new folder.
Unknown Host
An unknown host error indicates that the server with the requested name, %1, could not be located on the Internet.
The name that you typed, %1, may not exist: it may be incorrectly typed.
Access Denied
Access was denied to the specified resource, %1.
You may have supplied incorrect authentication details or none at all.
Your account may not have permission to access the specified resource.
Retry the request and ensure your authentication details are entered correctly.
Write Access Denied
This means that an attempt to write to the file %1 was rejected.
Unable to Enter Folder
This means that an attempt to enter (in other words, to open) the requested folder %1 was rejected.
Folder Listing Unavailable
Protocol %1 is not a Filesystem
This means that a request was made which requires determining the contents of the folder, and the KDE program supporting this protocol is unable to do so.
Cyclic Link Detected
UNIX environments are commonly able to link a file or folder to a separate name and/ or location. KDE detected a link or series of links that results in an infinite loop - i. e. the file was (perhaps in a roundabout way) linked to itself.
Delete one part of the loop in order that it does not cause an infinite loop, and try again.
Request Aborted By User
The request was not completed because it was aborted.
Retry the request.
Cyclic Link Detected During Copy
UNIX environments are commonly able to link a file or folder to a separate name and/ or location. During the requested copy operation, KDE detected a link or series of links that results in an infinite loop - i. e. the file was (perhaps in a roundabout way) linked to itself.
Could Not Create Network Connection
Could Not Create Socket
This is a fairly technical error in which a required device for network communications (a socket) could not be created.
The network connection may be incorrectly configured, or the network interface may not be enabled.
Connection to Server Refused
The server %1 refused to allow this computer to make a connection.
The server, while currently connected to the Internet, may not be configured to allow requests.
The server, while currently connected to the Internet, may not be running the requested service (%1).
A network firewall (a device which restricts Internet requests), either protecting your network or the network of the server, may have intervened, preventing this request.
Connection to Server Closed Unexpectedly
Although a connection was established to %1, the connection was closed at an unexpected point in the communication.
A protocol error may have occurred, causing the server to close the connection as a response to the error.
URL Resource Invalid
Protocol %1 is not a Filter Protocol
The U niform R esource L ocator (URL) that you entered did not refer to a valid mechanism of accessing the specific resource, %1%2.
KDE is able to communicate through a protocol within a protocol. This request specified a protocol be used as such, however this protocol is not capable of such an action. This is a rare event, and is likely to indicate a programming error.
Unable to Initialize Input/ Output Device
Could Not Mount Device
The requested device could not be initialized ("mounted"). The reported error was: %1
The device may not be ready, for example there may be no media in a removable media device (i. e. no CD-ROM in a CD drive), or in the case of a peripheral/ portable device, the device may not be correctly connected.
You may not have permissions to initialize ("mount") the device. On UNIX systems, often system administrator privileges are required to initialize a device.
Check that the device is ready; removable drives must contain media, and portable devices must be connected and powered on.; and try again.
Unable to Uninitialize Input/ Output Device
Could Not Unmount Device
The requested device could not be uninitialized ("unmounted"). The reported error was: %1
The device may be busy, that is, still in use by another application or user. Even such things as having an open browser window on a location on this device may cause the device to remain in use.
You may not have permissions to uninitialize ("unmount") the device. On UNIX systems, system administrator privileges are often required to uninitialize a device.
Check that no applications are accessing the device, and try again.
Cannot Read From Resource
This means that although the resource, %1, was able to be opened, an error occurred while reading the contents of the resource.
You may not have permissions to read from the resource.
Cannot Write to Resource
This means that although the resource, %1, was able to be opened, an error occurred while writing to the resource.
You may not have permissions to write to the resource.
Could Not Listen for Network Connections
Could Not Bind
This is a fairly technical error in which a required device for network communications (a socket) could not be established to listen for incoming network connections.
Could Not Listen
Could Not Accept Network Connection
This is a fairly technical error in which an error occurred while attempting to accept an incoming network connection.
You may not have permissions to accept the connection.
Could Not Login: %1
An attempt to login to perform the requested operation was unsuccessful.
Could Not Determine Resource Status
Could Not Stat Resource
An attempt to determine information about the status of the resource %1, such as the resource name, type, size, etc., was unsuccessful.
The specified resource may not have existed or may not be accessible.
Could Not Cancel Listing
FIXME: Document this

The specified folder may not exist.
The specified folder may not be empty.
Ensure that the folder exists and is empty, and try again.
Could Not Resume File Transfer
The specified request asked that the transfer of file %1 be resumed at a certain point of the transfer. This was not possible.
The protocol, or the server, may not support file resuming.
Retry the request without attempting to resume transfer.
Could Not Rename Resource
An attempt to rename the specified resource %1 failed.

The program on your computer which provides access to the %1 protocol could not obtain the memory required to continue.
Unknown Proxy Host
While retrieving information about the specified proxy host, %1, an Unknown Host error was encountered. An unknown host error indicates that the requested name could not be located on the Internet.
There may have been a problem with your network configuration, specifically your proxy's hostname. If you have been accessing the Internet with no problems recently, this is unlikely.
Double-check your proxy settings and try again.
Authentication Failed: Method %1 Not Supported
Although you may have supplied the correct authentication details, the authentication failed because the method that the server is using is not supported by the KDE program implementing the protocol %1.
Please file a bug at http: / /bugs. kde. org/ to inform the KDE team of the unsupported authentication method.
Request Aborted
Internal Error in Server
The program on the server which provides access to the %1 protocol has reported an internal error: %2.
This is most likely to be caused by a bug in the server program. Please consider submitting a full bug report as detailed below.
Contact the administrator of the server to advise them of the problem.
If you know who the authors of the server software are, submit the bug report directly to them.
Timeout Error
Although contact was made with the server, a response was not received within the amount of time allocated for the request as follows: Timeout for establishing a connection: %1 seconds Timeout for receiving a response: %2 seconds Timeout for accessing proxy servers: %3 seconds Please note that you can alter these timeout settings in the KDE System Settings, by selecting Network Settings - > Connection Preferences.
The server was too busy responding to other requests to respond.

This option enables some convenient features for saving files with extensions: Any extension specified in the %1 text area will be updated if you change the file type to save in. If no extension is specified in the %2 text area when you click Save, %3 will be added to the end of the filename (if the filename does not already exist). This extension is based on the file type that you have chosen to save in. If you do not want KDE to supply an extension for the filename, you can either turn this option off or you can suppress it by adding a period (.) to the end of the filename (the period will be automatically removed). If unsure, keep this option enabled as it makes your files more manageable.
This button allows you to bookmark specific locations. Click on this button to open the bookmark menu where you may add, edit or select a bookmark. These bookmarks are specific to the file dialog, but otherwise operate like bookmarks elsewhere in KDE.

KWallet - The KDE Wallet System
Welcome to KWallet, the KDE Wallet System. KWallet allows you to store your passwords and other personal information on disk in an encrypted file, preventing others from viewing the information. This wizard will tell you about KWallet and help you configure it for the first time.
& Basic setup (recommended)
& Advanced setup
Various applications may attempt to use the KDE wallet to store passwords or other information such as web form data and cookies. If you would like these applications to use the wallet, you must enable it now and choose a password. The password you choose cannot be recovered if it is lost, and will allow anyone who knows it to obtain all the information contained in the wallet.
Yes, I wish to use the KDE wallet to store my personal information.
Enter a new password:
Verify password:
The KDE Wallet system stores your data in a wallet file on your local hard disk. The data is only written in encrypted form, presently using the blowfish algorithm with your password as the key. When a wallet is opened, the wallet manager application will launch and display an icon in the system tray. You can use this application to manage your wallets. It even permits you to drag wallets and wallet contents, allowing you to easily copy a wallet to a remote system.
The KDE Wallet system allows you to control the level of security of your personal data. Some of these settings do impact usability. While the default settings are generally acceptable for most users, you may wish to change some of them. You may further tune these settings from the KWallet control module.

KDE Audio CD IO Slave
(c) 2000 - 2005 Audio CD developers
Audio CDs The Audio CD IO-Slave enables you to easily create wav, MP3 or Ogg Vorbis files from your audio CD-ROMs or DVDs. The slave is invoked by typing "audiocd: /" in Konqueror's location bar. In this module, you can configure encoding, and device settings. Note that MP3 and Ogg Vorbis encoding are only available if KDE was built with a recent version of the LAME or Ogg Vorbis libraries.
Highest
Lowest
/ dev/ cdrom
Specify a location for the drive you want to use. Normally, this is a file inside the / dev folder representing your CD or DVD drive.
& Specify CD Device:
Uncheck this if you want to specify a CD device different from the one autoprobed
If you uncheck this option, the slave will not try to use error correction which can be useful for reading damaged CDs. However, this feature can be problematic in some cases, so you can switch it off here.

Uninvited Connections
Allow & uninvited connections
Select this option to allow connecting without inviting. This is useful if you want to access your desktop remotely.
Announce service & on the network
If you allow uninvited connections and enable this option, Desktop Sharing will announce the service and your identity on the local network, so people can find you and your computer.
Confirm uninvited connections & before accepting
If enabled, a dialog will appear when somebody attempts to connect, asking you whether you want to accept the connection.
Allow uninvited connections to control the desktop
Enable this option to allow uninvited user to control your desktop (using mouse and keyboard).
Password:
If you allow uninvited connections, it is highly recommended to set a password in order to protect your computer from unauthorized access.
& Session
Session Preferences
Always disable & background image
Check this option to always disable the background image during a remote session. Otherwise the client decides whether the background will be enabled or disabled.
& Network
Network Port
Assign port automatically
Check this option to assign the network port automatically. This is recommended unless your network setup requires you to use a fixed port, for example because of a firewall.
Port:
Enter the TCP port number here
Use this field to set a static port number for the desktop sharing service. Note that if the port is already in use the Desktop Sharing service will not be accessible until you free it. It is recommended to assign the port automatically unless you know what you are doing. Most VNC clients use a display number instead of the actual port. This display number is the offset to port 5900, so port 5901 has the display number 1.

Allowed & Hosts
A list of allowed hosts

Name/ Address
Parameters
Host Properties
& Name/ address:
Name / Address field Here you can enter the host name or address. The host may be specified in a number of ways: single host This is the most common format. You may specify a host either by an abbreviated name recognized by the resolver, the fully qualified domain name, or an IP address. netgroups NIS netgroups may be given as @group. Only the host part of each netgroup members is consider in checking for membership. Empty host parts or those containing a single dash (-) are ignored. wildcards Machine names may contain the wildcard characters * and?. This can be used to make the exports file more compact; for instance, *. cs. foo. edu matches all hosts in the domain cs. foo. edu. However, these wildcard characters do not match the dots in a domain name, so the above pattern does not include hosts such as a. b. cs. foo. edu. IP networks You can also export directories to all hosts on an IP (sub-) network simultaneously. This is done by specifying an IP address and netmask pair as address/ netmask where the netmask can be specified in dotted-decimal format, or as a contiguous mask length (for example, either ` / 255.255.252.0 'or ` / 22' appended to the network base address result in identical subnetworks with 10 bits of host).
& Public access
Public access If you check this, the host address will be a single wildcard, which means public access. This is just the same as if you would enter a wildcard in the address field.
Options
& Writable
Writable Allow both read and write requests on this NFS volume. The default is to disallow any request which changes the filesystem
& Insecure
Insecure If this option is checked, it is not required that requests originate on an internet port less than IPPORT_RESERVED (1024). If unsure leave it unchecked.
& Sync
Sync This option requests that all file writes be committed to disk before the write request completes. This is required for complete safety of data in the face of a server crash, but incurs a performance hit. The default is to allow the server to write the data out whenever it is ready.
No wdelay
No wdelay This option only has effect if sync is also set. The NFS server will normally delay committing a write request to disk slightly if it suspects that another related write request may be in progress or may arrive soon. This allows multiple write requests to be committed to disk with the one operation which can improve performance. If an NFS server received mainly small unrelated requests, this behavior could actually reduce performance, so no wdelay is available to turn it off.
No & hide
No hide This option is based on the option of the same name provided in IRIX NFS. Normally, if a server exports two filesystems one of which is mounted on the other, then the client will have to mount both filesystems explicitly to get access to them. If it just mounts the parent, it will see an empty directory at the place where the other filesystem is mounted. That filesystem is "hidden". Setting the nohide option on a filesystem causes it not to be hidden, and an appropriately authorized client will be able to move from the parent to that filesystem without noticing the change. However, some NFS clients do not cope well with this situation as, for instance, it is then possible for two files in the one apparent filesystem to have the same inode number. The nohide option is currently only effective on single host exports. It does not work reliably with netgroup, subnet, or wildcard exports. This option can be very useful in some situations, but it should be used with due care, and only after confirming that the client system copes with the situation effectively.
No subtree check
No subtree check This option disables subtree checking, which has mild security implications, but can improve reliability is some circumstances. If a subdirectory of a filesystem is exported, but the whole filesystem is not, then whenever a NFS request arrives, the server must check not only that the accessed file is in the appropriate filesystem (which is easy) but also that it is in the exported tree (which is harder). This check is called the subtree_check. In order to perform this check, the server must include some information about the location of the file in the "filehandle" that is given to the client. This can cause problems with accessing files that are renamed while a client has them open (though in many simple cases it will still work). subtree checking is also used to make sure that files inside directories to which only root has access can only be accessed if the filesystem is exported with no_root_squash (see below), even the file itself allows more general access. As a general guide, a home directory filesystem, which is normally exported at the root and may see lots of file renames, should be exported with subtree checking disabled. A filesystem which is mostly read-only, and at least does not see many file renames (e. g. / usr or / var) and for which subdirectories may be exported, should probably be exported with subtree checks enabled.
Insecure locks
Insecure locks This option tells the NFS server not to require authentication of locking requests (i. e. requests which use the NLM protocol). Normally the NFS server will require a lock request to hold a credential for a user who has read access to the file. With this flag no access checks will be performed. Early NFS client implementations did not send credentials with lock requests, and many current NFS clients still exist which are based on the old implementations. Use this flag if you find that you can only lock files which are world readable.
User Mapping
All squash
All squash Map all uids and gids to the anonymous user. Useful for NFS-exported public FTP directories, news spool directories, etc.
No & root squash
No root squash Turn of root squashing. This option is mainly useful for diskless clients. root squashing Map requests from uid/ gid 0 to the anonymous uid/ gid. Note that this does not apply to any other uids that might be equally sensitive, such as user bin.
Anonym. & UID:
Anonym. UID/ GID These options explicitly set the uid and gid of the anonymous account. This option is primarily useful for PC/ NFS clients, where you might want all requests appear to be from one user.

Samba Configuration here you can configure your SAMBA server.
Use the share security level if you have a home network or a small office network. It allows everyone to read the list of all your shared directories and printers before a login is required.
Use the user security level if you have a bigger network and you do not want to allow everyone to read your list of shared directories and printers without a login. If you want to run your Samba server as a Primary Domain controller (PDC) you also have to set this option.
Use the server security level if you have a big network and the samba server should validate the username/ password by passing it to another SMB server, such as an NT box.
Use the domain security level if you have a big network and the samba server should validate the username/ password by passing it to a Windows NT Primary or Backup Domain Controller.
Use the ADS security level if you have a big network and the samba server should act as a domain member in an ADS realm.

Phone number:
& Add...
& Remove
Specifies the phone numbers to dial. You can supply multiple numbers here, simply click on "Add". You can arrange the order the numbers are tried by using the arrow buttons. When a number is busy or fails, kppp will try the next number and so on
Authentication:
Script-based
PAP
Terminal-based
CHAP
PAP/ CHAP
Specifies the method used to identify yourself to the PPP server. Most universities still use Terminal- or Script-based authentication, while most ISP use PAP and/ or CHAP. If unsure, contact your ISP. If you can choose between PAP and CHAP, choose CHAP, because it is much safer. If you do not know whether PAP or CHAP is right, choose PAP/ CHAP.
Store & password
When this is turned on, your ISP password will be saved in kppp's config file, so you do not need to type it in every time. Warning: your password will be stored as plain text in the config file, which is readable only to you. Make sure nobody gains access to this file!
& Callback type:
Administrator-defined
User-defined
Callback type
Callback number:
Callback phone number
Customize & pppd Arguments...
Here you can select commands to run at certain stages of the connection. The commands are run with your real user id, so you cannot run any commands here requiring root permissions (unless, of course, you are root). Be sure to supply the whole path to the program otherwise kppp might be unable to find it.
& Before connect:
Allows you to run a program before a connection is established. It is called immediately before dialing has begun. This might be useful, e. g. to stop HylaFAX blocking the modem.
& Upon connect:
Allows you to run a program after a connection is established. When your program is called, all preparations for an Internet connection are finished. Very useful for fetching mail and news
Before & disconnect:
Allows you to run a program before a connection is closed. The connection will stay open until the program exits.
Upon disconnect:
Allows you to run a program after a connection has been closed.
Configuration
Dynamic IP address
Select this option when your computer gets an internet address (IP) every time a connection is made. Almost every Internet Service Provider uses this method, so this should be turned on.
Static IP address
Select this option when your computer has a fixed internet address (IP). Most computers do not have one, so you should probably select dynamic IP addressing unless you know what you are doing.
& IP address:
If your computer has a permanent internet address, you must supply your IP address here.
& Subnet mask:
If your computer has a static Internet address, you must supply a network mask here. In almost all cases this netmask will be 255.255.255.0, but your mileage may vary. If unsure, contact your Internet Service Provider
& Auto-configure hostname from this IP
Whenever you connect, this reconfigures your hostname to match the IP address you got from the PPP server. This may be useful if you need to use a protocol which depends on this information, but it can also cause several problems. Do not enable this unless you really need it.
Selecting this option might cause some weird problems with the X-server and applications while kppp is connected. Do not use it unless you know what you are doing. For more information take a look at the handbook (or help) in the "Frequently asked questions" section.
Warning
Domain & name:
If you enter a domain name here, this domain name is used for your computer while you are connected. When the connection is closed, the original domain name of your computer is restored. If you leave this field blank, no changes are made to the domain name.
Configuration:
Automatic
Manual
DNS & IP address:
Allows you to specify a new DNS server to be used while you are connected. When the connection is closed, this DNS entry will be removed again. To add a DNS server, type in the IP address of the DNS server here and click on Add
& Add
Click this button to add the DNS server specified in the field above. The entry will then be added to the list below
Click this button to remove the selected DNS server entry from the list below
DNS address & list:
This shows all defined DNS servers to use while you are connected. Use the Add and Remove buttons to modify the list
& Disable existing DNS servers during connection
When this option is selected, all DNS servers specified in / etc/ resolv. conf are temporary disabled while the dialup connection is established. After the connection is closed, the servers will be re-enabled Typically, there is no reason to use this option, but it may become useful under some circumstances.
Default gateway
This makes the PPP peer computer (the computer you are connected to with your modem) to act as a gateway. Your computer will send all packets not going to a computer inside your local net to this computer, which will route these packets. This is the default for most ISPs, so you should probably leave this option on.
Static gateway
Allows you to specify which computer you want to use as gateway (see Default Gateway above)
Gateway & IP address:
& Assign the default route to this gateway
If this option is enabled, all packets not going to the local net are routed through the PPP connection. Normally, you should turn this on
& Insert
Add Phone Number
Enter a phone number:
pppd version:
pppd & timeout:
sec
kppp will wait this number of seconds to see if a PPP connection is established. If no connection is made in this time frame, kppp will give up and kill pppd.
Dock into panel on connect
After a connection is established, the window is minimized and a small icon in the KDE panel represents this window. Clicking on this icon will restore the window to its original location and size.
Automatic redial on disconnect
When a connection is established and it somehow gets disconnected, kppp will try to reconnect to the same account. See here for more on this topic.
Automatic redial on NO & CARRIER
When dialing if modem returns NO CARRIER the program will make a new attempt to redial instead of waiting for user to click < CANCEL > button.
& Show clock on caption
When this option is checked, the window title shows the time since a connection was established. Very useful, so you should turn this on
Disconnect on X server shutdown
Checking this option will close any open connection when the X-server is shut down. You should enable this option unless you know what you are doing. See here for more on this.
& Quit on disconnect
When this option is turned on, kppp will be closed when you disconnect
Minimize window on connect
Iconifies kppp's window when a connection is established
Modem & name:
Type in a unique name for this modem
Modem device:
This specifies the serial port your modem is attached to. On Linux/ x86, typically this is either / dev/ ttyS0 (COM1 under DOS) or / dev/ ttyS1 (COM2 under DOS). If you have an internal ISDN card with AT command emulation (most cards under Linux support this), you should select one of the / dev/ ttyIx devices.
& Flow control:
Software [XON/ XOFF]
Specifies how the serial port and modem communicate. You should not change this unless you know what you are doing. Default: CRTSCTS
& Line termination:
Specifies how AT commands are sent to your modem. Most modems will work fine with the default CR/ LF. If your modem does not react to the init string, you should try different settings here Default: CR/ LF
Connection speed:
Specifies the speed your modem and the serial port talk to each other. You should begin with at least 115200 bits/ sec (or more if you know that your serial port supports higher speeds). If you have connection problems, try to reduce this value.
& Use lock file
To prevent other programs from accessing the modem while a connection is established, a file can be created to indicate that the modem is in use. On Linux an example file would be / var/ lock/ LCK.. ttyS1 Here you can select whether this locking will be done. Default: On
Modem & timeout:
This specifies how long kppp waits for a CONNECT response from your modem. The recommended value is 30 seconds.
& Wait for dial tone before dialing
Normally the modem waits for a dial tone from your phone line, indicating that it can start to dial a number. If your modem does not recognize this sound, or your local phone system does not emit such a tone, uncheck this option Default:: On
Busy wait:
Specifies the number of seconds to wait before redial if all dialed numbers are busy. This is necessary because some modems get stuck if the same number is busy too often. The default is 0 seconds, you should not change this unless you need to.
Modem & volume:
Most modems have a speaker which makes a lot of noise when dialing. Here you can either turn this completely off or select a lower volume. If this does not work for your modem, you must modify the modem volume command.
Modem asserts CD line
This controls how kppp detects that the modem is not responding. Unless you are having problems with this, do not modify this setting. Default: Off
Modem Commands...
Allows you to change the AT command for your modem.
& Query Modem...
Most modems support the ATI command set to find out vendor and revision of your modem. Press this button to query your modem for this information. It can be useful to help you set up the modem
& Terminal...
Opens the built-in terminal program. You can use this if you want to play around with your modem's AT command set

Recent Changes in KPPP
From version 1.4.8 on, kppp has a new feature called "Quickhelp". It is similar to a tooltip, but you can activate it whenever you want. To activate it, simply click on a control (like a button or a label) with the right mouse button. If the item supports Quickhelp, a popup menu will appear leading to Quickhelp. To test it, right-click somewhere in this text.
Do not show this hint again
This is an example of QuickHelp. This window will stay open until you click a mouse button or a press a key.

Notice that the remote system has sent the following message: "%1" This may give you a hint why the connection has failed.
Unable to provide help.
KPPP could not prepare a PPP log. It is very likely that pppd was started without the "debug" option. Without this option it is difficult to find out PPP problems, so in general the debug option should be used. Enable debug now, and restart pppd?
Restart pppd
Do Not Restart
The "debug" option has been added. You should now try to reconnect. If that fails again, you will get a PPP log that may help you to track down the connection problem.

Connection type:
Use this to specify the performance of your connection. Note that you should select the speed of the weakest link - even if you have a high speed connection, it will not help you if the remote computer uses a slow modem. Choosing a level of quality that is too high on a slow link will cause slower response times. Choosing a lower quality will increase latencies in high speed connections and results in lower image quality, especially in'Low Quality 'mode.
High Quality (LAN, direct connection)
Medium Quality (DSL, Cable, fast Internet)
Low Quality (Modem, ISDN, slow Internet)

An invitation creates a one-time password that allows the receiver to connect to your desktop. It is valid for only one successful connection and will expire after an hour if it has not been used. When somebody connects to your computer a dialog will appear and ask you for permission. The connection will not be established before you accept it. In this dialog you can also restrict the other person to view your desktop only, without the ability to move your mouse pointer or press keys. If you want to create a permanent password for Desktop Sharing, allow'Uninvited Connections' in the configuration.

Desktop Sharing uses the VNC protocol. You can use any VNC client to connect. In KDE the client is called'Remote Desktop Connection '. Enter the host information into the client and it will connect..
This field contains the address of your computer and the display number, separated by a colon. The address is just a hint - you can use any address that can reach your computer. Desktop Sharing tries to guess your address from your network configuration, but does not always succeed in doing so. If your computer is behind a firewall it may have a different address or be unreachable for other computers.

Main Toolbar
Kate comes with a nice set of plugins, providing simple and advanced features of all sorts. You can enable/ disable plugins to suit your needs in the configuration dialog, choose Settings -gt; configure to launch that.
You can swap the characters on each side of the cursor just by pressing Ctrl+T
You can export the current document as a HTML file, including syntax highlighting. Just choose File -gt; Export -gt; HTML...
You can split the Kate editor as many times as you like and in either direction. Each frame has its own status bar and can display any open document. Just choose View -gt; Split [Horizontal _BAR_ Vertical]
You can drag the Tool views (File List and File Selector) to any side that you want them in Kate, or stack them, or even tear them off the main window.
Kate has a built-in terminal emulator, just click on "Terminal" at the bottom to show or hide it as you desire.
Kate can highlight the current line with a different background color. _BAR_ You can set the color in the Colors page of the configuration dialog.
You can open the currently edited file in any other application from within Kate. Choose File -gt; Open With for the list of programs configured for the document type. There is also an option Other... to choose any application on your system.
You can configure the editor to always display the line numbers and/ or bookmark panes when started from the View Defaults page of the configuration dialog.
You can download new or updated Syntax highlight definitions from the Highlighting page in the configuration dialog. Just click the Download... button on the Open/ Save -gt; Modes & Filetypes tab (You have to be online, of course...).
You can cycle through all open documents by pressing Alt+Left or Alt+Right. The next/ previous document will immediately be displayed in the active frame.
You can do cool sed-like regular expression replacements using Command Line. For example, press F7 and enter s / oldtext/ newtext/ g to replace & quot; oldtextquot; with & quot; newtextquot; throughout the current line.
You can repeat your last search by just pressing F3, or Shift+F3 if you want to search backwards.
You can filter the files displayed in the File Selector tool view. Simply enter your filter in the filter entry at the bottom, for example: *. html *. php if you only want to see HTML and PHP files in the current folder. The File Selector will even remember your filters for you .< strong >
You can have two views - or even more - of the same document in Kate. Editing in either will be reflected in both. So if you find yourself scrolling up and down to look at text at the other end of a document, just press Ctrl+Shift+T to split horizontally.
Press F8 or Shift+F8 to switch to the next/ previous frame.

These options allow you to have the File Selector automatically change location to the folder of the active document on certain events. Auto synchronization is lazy, meaning it will not take effect until the file selector is visible.

You can choose a template for the pattern from the combo box and edit it here. The string %s in the template is replaced by the pattern input field, resulting in the regular expression to search for.
If this is enabled, your pattern will be passed unmodified to grep(1). Otherwise, all characters that are not letters will be escaped using a backslash character to prevent grep from interpreting them as part of the expression.

You can select a background image from this list. Initially, the installed KDE wallpapers will be offered. If you do not find what you are looking for here, you can select any image file by clicking on the Browse button below.

This area will always display the currently selected background image. Note that the image will be scaled and thus might have a different ratio than it originally had.
In this box, you can set various settings that control how the background image is displayed.
& Intensity in%:
Here you can select how much the image should be brightened up so that it does not disturb the selected area too much. Different images require different settings, but 25% is a good value to start with.
If you check this box, the selected image will be scaled to fit the total size of the selected area. Image ratio will be adjusted to match the area size and height if necessary.
If you check this box, the selected image will be centered over the selected area. If the image is larger then the area, you will only see the middle part of it.

However you do n't need to install all of those. Right now the fonts cmbx10, cmex10, cmmi10, cmr10, cmsy10, msam10 and msbm10 are required.

Crop picture to edges
Do n't export extra blank space to file
Crop picture to edges This will eliminate all blank portions of the drawing. The picture will only be as large as the stencils it contains. If your stencils are located in the upper right corner of the page, then only the upper right corner will be exported.
& Quality:
The higher the quality, the more space the file takes up
Quality Not all file formats use this. But for those that do, this affects the quality of the image that gets exported. 100 is the maximum quality. The higher the number, the better the picture looks. The downside is the higher the number, the larger the filesize.
An optional border of whitespace around the page, in pixels
Border Places a blank border around the edges of the image. This can be used if for one reason or another, the stencils do n't fit into the export page with a 0-pixel border (default).

Autocorrection
Simple Autocorrection
Detect when a new sentence is started and always ensure that the first character is an uppercase character.
Convert & two uppercase characters to one uppercase and one lowercase character (e. g. PErfect to Perfect)
Detect when a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is typed and provide formatting that matches the way an Internet browser would show a URL.
& Suppress double spaces
Remove spaces at the beginning and end of paragraphs
Automatically do & bold and underline formatting
When typing '1) 'or similar in front of a paragraph, automatically convert the paragraph to use that numbering style. This has the advantage that further paragraphs will also be numbered and the spacing is done correctly.
Replace 1st... with 1^st...
When typing '* 'or '-' in front of a paragraph, automatically convert the paragraph to use that list-style. Using a list-style formatting means that a correct bullet is used to draw the list.

Select the encoding of the Write document. Try the Default Encoding (CP 1252), if unsure.
& Other encoding:
& Default encoding (CP 1252)
Most Write documents are stored using this encoding (also known as windows-1252). Select this if unsure.
& Advanced
These advanced options allow you to fine-tune the importing of formatting information. They compensate for differences between KWord and MS Write by adding extra formatting information (not found in the original document), to try to make the imported document look as close to the original as possible. It is safe to use the defaults, if unsure.
Compensate for & linespacing differences
Try to simulate Write's linespacing by adding some spaces before each paragraph.
Enable & image positioning
Use paragraph indentation to position images.

The maximum number of "tiles" that are kept in memory. For regular RGBA8 images, each tile is about 16 kB in size. Thus, for a value of 500 tiles this usually means about 8 megabytes are used for image data. If you regularly handle large images, a greater value here might be useful. Note that this number is only a guideline for Krita, and is not guaranteed to be the actual number of tiles in memory.
Maximum number of tiles kept in memory:
This configures how much Krita will use the swap file. If you move the slider all the way to the left, Krita will not use the swap file at all. If you move it all the way to the right, Krita will make maximum use of the swap file.
This configures how much Krita likes to swap. Move the slider to the left, and there is no swapping at all. Move it to the right there is a lot of swapping going on.

Colorspace Conversion
& Rendering Intent
For images
Hue hopefully maintained (but not required), lightness and saturation sacrificed to maintain the perceived color. White point changed to result in neutral grays. Intended for images.
Best for graphs and charts
Hue and saturation maintained with lightness sacrificed to maintain saturation. White point changed to result in neutral grays. Intended for business graphics (make it colorful charts, graphs, overheads,...) If adequate table is present in profile, then, it is used. Else reverts to perceptual intent.
Best for spot colours

Server name (ServerName) The hostname of your server, as advertised to the world. By default CUPS will use the hostname of the system. To set the default server used by clients, see the client. conf file. ex: myhost. domain. com
Server administrator (ServerAdmin) The email address to send all complaints or problems to. By default CUPS will use "root@hostname". ex: root@myhost. com
Access log (AccessLog) The access log file; if this does not start with a leading / then it is assumed to be relative to ServerRoot. By default set to "/ var/ log/ cups/ access_log". You can also use the special name syslog to send the output to the syslog file or daemon. ex: / var/ log/ cups/ access_log
Data directory (DataDir) The root directory for the CUPS data files. By default / usr/ share/ cups. ex: / usr/ share/ cups
Default character set (DefaultCharset) The default character set to use. If not specified, defaults to utf-8. Note that this can also be overridden in HTML documents... ex: utf-8
Default language (DefaultLanguage) The default language if not specified by the browser. If not specified, the current locale is used. ex: en
Document directory (DocumentRoot) The root directory for HTTP documents that are served. By default the compiled-in directory. ex: / usr/ share/ cups/ doc
Error log (ErrorLog) The error log file; if this does not start with a leading / then it is assumed to be relative to ServerRoot. By default set to "/ var/ log/ cups/ error_log". You can also use the special name syslog to send the output to the syslog file or daemon. ex: / var/ log/ cups/ error_log
Font path (FontPath) The path to locate all font files (currently only for pstoraster). By default / usr/ share/ cups/ fonts. ex: / usr/ share/ cups/ fonts
Log level (LogLevel) Controls the number of messages logged to the ErrorLog file and can be one of the following: debug2: Log everything. debug: Log almost everything. info: Log all requests and state changes. warn: Log errors and warnings. error: Log only errors. none: Log nothing. ex: info
Max log size (MaxLogSize) Controls the maximum size of each log file before they are rotated. Defaults to 1048576 (1MB). Set to 0 to disable log rotating. ex: 1048576
Page log (PageLog) The page log file; if this does not start with a leading / then it is assumed to be relative to ServerRoot. By default set to "/ var/ log/ cups/ page_log". You can also use the special name syslog to send the output to the syslog file or daemon. ex: / var/ log/ cups/ page_log
Preserve job history (PreserveJobHistory) Whether or not to preserve the job history after a job is completed, canceled, or stopped. Default is Yes. ex: Yes
Preserve job files (PreserveJobFiles) Whether or not to preserve the job files after a job is completed, canceled, or stopped. Default is No. ex: No
Printcap file (Printcap) The name of the printcap file. Default is no filename. Leave blank to disable printcap file generation. ex: / etc/ printcap
Request directory (RequestRoot) The directory where request files are stored. By default / var/ spool/ cups. ex: / var/ spool/ cups
Remote root user (RemoteRoot) The name of the user assigned to unauthenticated accesses from remote systems. By default "remroot". ex: remroot
Server binaries (ServerBin) The root directory for the scheduler executables. By default / usr/ lib/ cups or / usr/ lib32/ cups (IRIX 6.5). ex: / usr/ lib/ cups
Server files (ServerRoot) The root directory for the scheduler. By default / etc/ cups. ex: / etc/ cups
User (User) The user the server runs under. Normally this must be lp, however you can configure things for another user as needed. Note: the server must be run initially as root to support the default IPP port of 631. It changes users whenever an external program is run... ex: lp
Group (Group) The group the server runs under. Normally this must be sys, however you can configure things for another group as needed. ex: sys
RIP cache (RIPCache) The amount of memory that each RIP should use to cache bitmaps. The value can be any real number followed by "k" for kilobytes, "m" for megabytes, "g" for gigabytes, or "t" for tiles (1 tile = 256x256 pixels). Defaults to "8m" (8 megabytes). ex: 8m
Temporary files (TempDir) The directory to put temporary files in. This directory must be writable by the user defined above! Defaults to "/ var/ spool/ cups/ tmp" or the value of the TMPDIR environment variable. ex: / var/ spool/ cups/ tmp
Filter limit (FilterLimit) Sets the maximum cost of all job filters that can be run at the same time. A limit of 0 means no limit. A typical job may need a filter limit of at least 200; limits less than the minimum required by a job force a single job to be printed at any time. The default limit is 0 (unlimited). ex: 200
Listen to (Port/ Listen) Ports/ addresses that are listened to. The default port 631 is reserved for the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) and is what is used here. You can have multiple Port/ Listen lines to listen to more than one port or address, or to restrict access. Note: Unfortunately, most web browsers do n't support TLS or HTTP Upgrades for encryption. If you want to support web-based encryption you will probably need to listen on port 443 (the "HTTPS" port...). ex: 631, myhost:80, 1.2.3.4:631
Hostname lookups (HostNameLookups) Whether or not to do lookups on IP addresses to get a fully-qualified hostname. This defaults to Off for performance reasons... ex: On
Keep alive (KeepAlive) Whether or not to support the Keep-Alive connection option. Default is on. ex: On
Keep-alive timeout (KeepAliveTimeout) The timeout (in seconds) before Keep-Alive connections are automatically closed. Default is 60 seconds. ex: 60
Max clients (MaxClients) Controls the maximum number of simultaneous clients that will be handled. Defaults to 100. ex: 100
Max request size (MaxRequestSize) Controls the maximum size of HTTP requests and print files. Set to 0 to disable this feature (defaults to 0). ex: 0
Client timeout (Timeout) The timeout (in seconds) before requests time out. Default is 300 seconds. ex: 300
Use browsing (Browsing) Whether or not to listen to printer information from other CUPS servers. Enabled by default. Note: to enable the sending of browsing information from this CUPS server to the LAN, specify a valid BrowseAddress. ex: On
Use short names (BrowseShortNames) Whether or not to use "short" names for remote printers when possible (e. g. "printer" instead of "printer@host"). Enabled by default. ex: Yes
Browse addresses (BrowseAddress) Specifies a broadcast address to be used. By default browsing information is broadcast to all active interfaces. Note: HP-UX 10.20 and earlier do not properly handle broadcast unless you have a Class A, B, C, or D netmask (i. e. no CIDR support). ex: x. y. z.255, x. y.255.255
Browse allow/ deny (BrowseAllow/ BrowseDeny) BrowseAllow: specifies an address mask to allow for incoming browser packets. The default is to allow packets from all addresses. BrowseDeny: specifies an address mask to deny for incoming browser packets. The default is to deny packets from no addresses. Both "BrowseAllow" and "BrowseDeny" accept the following notations for addresses: All None *. domain. com. domain. com host. domain. com nnn. * nnn. nnn. * nnn. nnn. nnn. * nnn. nnn. nnn. nnn nnn. nnn. nnn. nnn/ mm nnn. nnn. nnn. nnn/ mmm. mmm. mmm. mmm The hostname/ domainname restrictions only work if you have turned hostname lookups on!
Browse interval (BrowseInterval) The time between browsing updates in seconds. Default is 30 seconds. Note that browsing information is sent whenever a printer's state changes as well, so this represents the maximum time between updates. Set this to 0 to disable outgoing broadcasts so your local printers are not advertised but you can still see printers on other hosts. ex: 30
Browse order (BrowseOrder) Specifies the order of BrowseAllow/ BrowseDeny comparisons. ex: allow, deny
Browse poll (BrowsePoll) Poll the named server(s) for printers. ex: myhost:631
Browse port (BrowsePort) The port used for UDP broadcasts. By default this is the IPP port; if you change this you need to do it on all servers. Only one BrowsePort is recognized. ex: 631
Browse relay (BrowseRelay) Relay browser packets from one address/ network to another. ex: src-address dest-address
Browse timeout (BrowseTimeout) The timeout (in seconds) for network printers - if we do n't get an update within this time the printer will be removed from the printer list. This number definitely should not be less the BrowseInterval value for obvious reasons. Defaults to 300 seconds. ex: 300
Implicit classes (ImplicitClasses) Whether or not to use implicit classes. Printer classes can be specified explicitly in the classes. conf file, implicitly based upon the printers available on the LAN, or both. When ImplicitClasses is On, printers on the LAN with the same name (e. g. Acme-LaserPrint-1000) will be put into a class with the same name. This allows you to setup multiple redundant queues on a LAN without a lot of administrative difficulties. If a user sends a job to Acme-LaserPrint-1000, the job will go to the first available queue. Enabled by default.
System group (SystemGroup) The group name for "System" (printer administration) access. The default varies depending on the operating system, but will be sys, system, or root (checked for in that order). ex: sys
Encryption certificate (ServerCertificate) The file to read containing the server's certificate. Defaults to "/ etc/ cups/ ssl/ server. crt". ex: / etc/ cups/ ssl/ server. crt
Encryption key (ServerKey) The file to read containing the server's key. Defaults to "/ etc/ cups/ ssl/ server. key". ex: / etc/ cups/ ssl/ server. key
Access permissions # Access permissions for each directory served by the scheduler. Locations are relative to DocumentRoot... # AuthType: the authorization to use: # None - Perform no authentication Basic - Perform authentication using the HTTP Basic method. Digest - Perform authentication using the HTTP Digest method. # (Note: local certificate authentication can be substituted by the client for Basic or Digest when connecting to the localhost interface) # AuthClass: the authorization class; currently only Anonymous, User, System (valid user belonging to group SystemGroup), and Group (valid user belonging to the specified group) are supported. # AuthGroupName: the group name for "Group" authorization. # Order: the order of Allow/ Deny processing. # Allow: allows access from the specified hostname, domain, IP address, or network. # Deny: denies access from the specified hostname, domain, IP address, or network. # Both "Allow" and "Deny" accept the following notations for addresses: # All None *. domain. com. domain. com host. domain. com nnn. * nnn. nnn. * nnn. nnn. nnn. * nnn. nnn. nnn. nnn nnn. nnn. nnn. nnn/ mm nnn. nnn. nnn. nnn/ mmm. mmm. mmm. mmm # The host and domain address require that you enable hostname lookups with "HostNameLookups On" above. # Encryption: whether or not to use encryption; this depends on having the OpenSSL library linked into the CUPS library and scheduler. # Possible values: # Always - Always use encryption (SSL) Never - Never use encryption Required - Use TLS encryption upgrade IfRequested - Use encryption if the server requests it # The default value is "IfRequested".
Authentication (AuthType) The authorization to use: None - Perform no authentication. Basic - Perform authentication using the HTTP Basic method. Digest - Perform authentication using the HTTP Digest method. Note: local certificate authentication can be substituted by the client for Basic or Digest when connecting to the localhost interface.
Class (AuthClass) The authorization class; currently only Anonymous, User, System (valid user belonging to group SystemGroup), and Group (valid user belonging to the specified group) are supported.
The user/ group names allowed to access the resource. The format is a comma separated list.
Satisfy (Satisfy) This directive controls whether all specified conditions must be satisfied to allow access to the resource. If set to "all", then all authentication and access control conditions must be satisfied to allow access. Setting Satisfy to "any" allows a user to gain access if the authentication or access control requirements are satisfied. For example, you might require authentication for remote access, but allow local access without authentication. The default is "all".
Authentication group name (AuthGroupName) The group name for Group authorization.
ACL order (Order) The order of Allow/ Deny processing.
Allow Allows access from the specified hostname, domain, IP address, or network. Possible values are: All None *. domain. com. domain. com host. domain. com nnn. * nnn. nnn. * nnn. nnn. nnn. * nnn. nnn. nnn. nnn nnn. nnn. nnn. nnn/ mm nnn. nnn. nnn. nnn/ mmm. mmm. mmm. mmm The host and domain address require that you enable hostname lookups with "HostNameLookups On" above.
ACL addresses (Allow/ Deny) Allows/ Denies access from the specified hostname, domain, IP address, or network. Possible values are: All None *. domain. com. domain. com host. domain. com nnn. * nnn. nnn. * nnn. nnn. nnn. * nnn. nnn. nnn. nnn nnn. nnn. nnn. nnn/ mm nnn. nnn. nnn. nnn/ mmm. mmm. mmm. mmm The host and domain address require that you enable hostname lookups with "HostNameLookups On" above.
Encryption (Encryption) Whether or not to use encryption; this depends on having the OpenSSL library linked into the CUPS library and scheduler. Possible values: Always - Always use encryption (SSL) Never - Never use encryption Required - Use TLS encryption upgrade IfRequested - Use encryption if the server requests it The default value is "IfRequested".
Access permissions Access permissions for each directory served by the scheduler. Locations are relative to DocumentRoot...
Auto purge jobs (AutoPurgeJobs) Automatically purge jobs when not needed for quotas. Default is No.
Browse protocols (BrowseProtocols) Which protocols to use for browsing. Can be any of the following separated by whitespace and/ or commas: all - Use all supported protocols. cups - Use the CUPS browse protocol. slp - Use the SLPv2 protocol. The default is cups. Note: If you choose to use SLPv2, it is strongly recommended that you have at least one SLP Directory Agent (DA) on your network. Otherwise, browse updates can take several seconds, during which the scheduler will not response to client requests.
Classification (Classification) The classification level of the server. If set, this classification is displayed on all pages, and raw printing is disabled. The default is the empty string. ex: confidential
Allow overrides (ClassifyOverride) Whether to allow users to override the classification on printouts. If enabled, users can limit banner pages to before or after the job, and can change the classification of a job, but cannot completely eliminate the classification or banners. The default is off.
Hide implicit members (HideImplicitMembers) Whether or not to show the members of an implicit class. When HideImplicitMembers is On, any remote printers that are part of an implicit class are hidden from the user, who will then only see a single queue even though many queues will be supporting the implicit class. Enabled by default.
Use & quot; anyquot; classes (ImplicitAnyClasses) Whether or not to create AnyPrinter implicit classes. When ImplicitAnyClasses is On and a local queue of the same name exists, e. g. "printer", "printer@server1", "printer@server1", then an implicit class called "Anyprinter" is created instead. When ImplicitAnyClasses is Off, implicit classes are not created when there is a local queue of the same name. Disabled by default.
Max jobs (MaxJobs) Maximum number of jobs to keep in memory (active and completed). Default is 0 (no limit).
Max jobs per user (MaxJobsPerUser) The MaxJobsPerUser directive controls the maximum number of active jobs that are allowed for each user. Once a user reaches the limit, new jobs will be rejected until one of the active jobs is completed, stopped, aborted, or canceled. Setting the maximum to 0 disables this functionality. Default is 0 (no limit).
Max jobs per printer (MaxJobsPerPrinter) The MaxJobsPerPrinter directive controls the maximum number of active jobs that are allowed for each printer or class. Once a printer or class reaches the limit, new jobs will be rejected until one of the active jobs is completed, stopped, aborted, or canceled. Setting the maximum to 0 disables this functionality. Default is 0 (no limit).
Port The port value that the CUPS daemon is listening to. Default is 631.
Address The address that the CUPS daemon is listening at. Leave it empty or use an asterisk (*) to specify a port value on the entire subnetwork.
Check this box if you want to use SSL encryption with this address/ port.

KDE Printing Management
(c) 2000 - 2002 Michael Goffioul
Michael Goffioul
Printers The KDE printing manager is part of KDEPrint which is the interface to the real print subsystem of your Operating System (OS). Although it does add some additional functionality of its own to those subsystems, KDEPrint depends on them for its functionality. Spooling and filtering tasks, especially, are still done by your print subsystem, or the administrative tasks (adding or modifying printers, setting access rights, etc.) What print features KDEPrint supports is therefore heavily dependent on your chosen print subsystem. For the best support in modern printing, the KDE Printing Team recommends a CUPS based printing system.

Taskbar
Show windows from all screens
Turning this option off will cause the taskbar to display only windows which are on the same Xinerama screen as the taskbar. By default, this option is selected and all windows are shown.
Sort windows by desktop
Selecting this option causes the taskbar to show windows in order of the desktop they appear on. By default this option is selected.
& Show windows from all desktops
Turning this option off will cause the taskbar to display only the windows on the current desktop. By default, this option is selected and all windows are shown.
Show application icons
Select this option if you want window icons to appear along with their titles in the taskbar. By default this option is selected.
Show window list & button
Selecting this option causes the taskbar to display a button that, when clicked, shows a list of all windows in a popup menu.
Show only minimized windows
Select this option if you want the taskbar to display only minimized windows. By default, this option is not selected and the taskbar will show all windows.
& Group similar tasks:
The taskbar can group similar windows into single buttons. When one of these window group buttons are clicked on a menu appears showing all the windows in that group. This can be especially useful with the Show all windows option. You can set the taskbar to Never group windows, to Always group windows or to group windows only When the Taskbar is Full. By default the taskbar groups windows when it is full.

Printer Location: The Location may describe where the selected printer is located. The Location description is created by the administrator of the print system (or may be left empty).
Printer Type: The Type indicates your printer type.
Printer State: The State indicates the state of the print queue on the print server (which could be your localhost). The state may be'Idle ', 'Processing', 'Stopped ', 'Paused' or similar.
Printer Comment: The Comment may describe the selected printer. This comment is created by the administrator of the print system (or may be left empty).
Printer Selection Menu: Use this combo box to select the printer to which you want to print. Initially (if you run KDEPrint for the first time), you may only find the KDE special printers (which save jobs to disk [as PostScript- or PDF-files], or deliver jobs via email (as a PDF attachment). If you are missing a real printer, you need to...... either create a local printer with the help of the KDE Add Printer Wizard. The Wizard is available for the CUPS and RLPR printing systems (click button to the left of the'Properties' button),... or try to connect to an existing remote CUPS print server. You can connect by clicking the'System Options' button below. A new dialog opens: click on the'CUPS server 'icon: Fill in the information required to use the remote server. Note: It may happen that you successfully connected to a remote CUPS server and still do not get a printer list. If this happens: force KDEPrint to re-load its configuration files. To reload the configuration files, either start kprinter again, or switch the print system away from CUPS and back again once. The print system switch can be made through a selection in the drop-down menu at bottom of this dialog when fully expanded).
Print Job Properties: This button opens a dialog where you can make decisions regarding all supported print job options.
Selective View on List of Printers: This button reduces the list of visible printers to a shorter, more convenient, pre-defined list. This is particularly useful in enterprise environments with lots of printers. The default is to show all printers. To create a personal'selective view list ', click on the'System Options' button at the bottom of this dialog. Then, in the new dialog, select'Filter '(left column in the KDE Print Configuration dialog) and setup your selection. Warning: Clicking this button without prior creation of a personal'selective view list' will make all printers dissappear from the view. (To re-enable all printers, just click this button again.)
KDE Add Printer Wizard This button starts the KDE Add Printer Wizard. Use the Wizard (with "CUPS" or "RLPR") to add locally defined printers to your system. Note: The KDE Add Printer Wizard does not work, and this button is disabled if you use "Generic LPD", "LPRng", or "Print Through an External Program".)
External Print Command Here you can enter any command that would also print for you in a konsole window. Example: a2ps -P & lt; printernamegt; --medium=A3.
Additional Print Job Options This button shows or hides additional printing options.
System Options: This button starts a new dialog where you can adjust various settings of your printing system. Amongst them: Should KDE applications embed all fonts into the PostScript they generate for printing? Should KDE use an external PostScript viewer like gv for print page previews? Should KDEPrint use a local or a remote CUPS server?, and many more....
Help: This button takes you to the complete KDEPrint Manual.
Cancel: This button cancels your print job and quits the kprinter dialog.
Print: This button sends the job to the printing process. If you are sending non-PostScript files, you may be asked if you want KDE to convert the files into PostScript, or if you want your print subsystem (like CUPS) to do this.
Keep Printing Dialog Open If you enable this checkbox, the printing dialog stays open after you hit the Print button. This is especially useful, if you need to test various print settings (like color matching for an inkjet printer) or if you want to send your job to multiple printers (one after the other) to have it finished more quickly.
Output File Name and Path: The "Output file:" shows you where your file will be saved if you decide to "Print to File" your job, using one of the KDE Special Printers named "Print to File (PostScript)" or "Print to File (PDF)". Choose a name and location that suits your need by using the button and/ or editing the line on the right.
Output File Name and Path: Edit this line to create a path and filename that suits your needs. (Button and Lineedit field are only available if you "Print to File")
Browse Directories button: This button calls the "File Open / Browse Directories" dialog to let you choose a directory and file name where your "Print-to-File" job should be saved.
Add File to Job This button calls the "File Open / Browse Directories" dialog to allow you to select a file for printing. Note, that you can select ASCII or International Text, PDF, PostScript, JPEG, TIFF, PNG, GIF and many other graphical formats. you can select various files from different paths and send them as one "multi-file job" to the printing system.
Print Preview Enable this checkbox if you want to see a preview of your printout. A preview lets you check if, for instance, your intended "poster" or "pamphlet" layout looks like you expected, without wasting paper first. It also lets you cancel the job if something looks wrong. Note: The preview feature (and therefore this checkbox) is only visible for printjobs created from inside KDE applications. If you start kprinter from the commandline, or if you use kprinter as a print command for non-KDE applications (like Acrobat Reader, Firefox or OpenOffice), print preview is not available here.
Set as Default Printer This button sets the current printer as the user's default. Note: (Button is only visible if the checkbox for System Options -- > General -- > Miscellaneous: "Defaults to the last printer used in the application" is disabled.)

Print Job Billing and Accounting Insert a meaningful string here to associate the current print job with a certain account. This string will appear in the CUPS "page_log" to help with the print accounting in your organization. (Leave it empty if you do not need it.) It is useful for people who print on behalf of different "customers", like print service bureaux, letter shops, press and prepress companies, or secretaries who serve different bosses, etc. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o job-billing=... # example: "Marketing_Department" or "Joe_Doe"
Scheduled Printing Scheduled printing lets you control the time of the actual printout, while you can still send away your job now and have it out of your way. Especially useful is the "Never (hold indefinitely)" option. It allows you to park your job until a time when you (or a printer administrator) decides to manually release it. This is often required in enterprise environments, where you normally are not allowed to directly and immediately access the huge production printers in your Central Repro Department. However it is okay to send jobs to the queue which is under the control of the operators (who, after all, need to make sure that the 10,000 sheets of pink paper which is required by the Marketing Department for a particular job are available and loaded into the paper trays.) Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o job-hold-until=... # example: "indefinite" or "no-hold"
Page Labels Page Labels are printed by CUPS at the top and bottom of each page. They appear on the pages surrounded by a little frame box. They contain any string you type into the line edit field. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o page-label= "..." # example: "Company Confidential"
Job Priority Usually CUPS prints all jobs per queue according to the "FIFO" principle: First In, First Out. The job priority option allows you to re-order the queue according to your needs. It works in both directions: you can increase as well as decrease priorities. (Usually you can only control your own jobs.) Since the default job priority is "50", any job sent with, for example, "49" will be printed only after all those others have finished. Conversely, a "51" or higher priority job will go right to the top of a populated queue (if no other, higher prioritized one is present.) Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o job-priority=... # example: "10" or "66" or "99"

Characters Per Inch This setting controls the horizontal size of characters when printing a text file. The default value is 10, meaning that the font is scaled in a way that 10 characters per inch will be printed. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o cpi=... # example: "8" or "12"
Lines Per Inch This setting controls the vertical size of characters when printing a text file. The default value is 6, meaning that the font is scaled in a way that 6 lines per inch will be printed. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o lpi=... # example "5" or "7"
Columns This setting controls how many columns of text will be printed on each page when printing text files. The default value is 1, meaning that only one column of text per page will be printed. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o columns=... # example: "2" or "4"
Preview icon changes when you turn on or off prettyprint.
Text Formats These settings control the appearance of text on printouts. They are only valid for printing text files or input directly through kprinter. Note: These settings have no effect whatsoever for input formats other than text, or for printing from applications such as the KDE Advanced Text Editor. (Applications in general send PostScript to the print system, and'kate 'in particular has its own knobs to control the print output.). Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o cpi=... # example: "8" or "12" -o lpi=... # example: "5" or "7" -o columns=... # example: "2" or "4"
Margins These settings control the margins of printouts on the paper. They are not valid for jobs originating from applications that define their own page layout internally and send PostScript to KDEPrint (such as KOffice or OpenOffice. org). When printing from KDE applications, such as KMail and Konqueror, or printing an ASCII text file through kprinter, you can choose your preferred margin settings here. Margins may be set individually for each edge of the paper. The combo box at the bottom lets you change the units of measurement between Pixels, Millimeters, Centimeters, and Inches. You can even use the mouse to grab one margin and drag it to the intended position (see the preview picture on the right side). Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o page-top=... # example: "72" -o page-bottom=... # example: "24" -o page-left=... # example: "36" -o page-right=... # example: "12"
Turn Text Printing with Syntax Highlighting (Prettyprint) On. ASCII text file printouts can be'prettyfied 'by enabling this option. If you do so, a header is printed at the top of each page. The header contains the page number, job title (usually the filename), and the date. In addition, C and C++ keywords are highlighted, and comment lines are italicized. This prettyprint option is handled by CUPS. If you prefer another'plaintext-to-prettyprint' converter, look for the enscript pre-filter on the Filters tab. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o prettyprint=true.
Turn Text Printing with Syntax Highlighting (Prettyprint) Off. ASCII text file printed with this option turned off appear without a page header and without syntax highlighting. (You can still set the page margins, though.) Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o prettyprint=false

'Use any current or future standard CUPS job option 'is not supported by the KDEPrint GUI. Control any custom job option you may want to support using custom CUPS filters and backends plugged into the CUPS filtering chain. Send short messages to the operators of your production printers in your Central Repro Department. Standard CUPS job options: A complete list of standard CUPS job options is in the CUPS User Manual. Mappings of the kprinter user interface widgets to respective CUPS job option names are provided in the various What's This help items. Custom CUPS job options: CUPS print servers may be customized with additional print filters and backends which understand custom job options. You can specify such custom job options here. If in doubt, ask your system administrator. Operator Messages: You may send additional messages to the operator(s) of your production printers (e. g. in your Central Repro Department). Messages can be read by the operator(s) (or yourself) by viewing the "Job IPP Report" for the job. Examples: A standard CUPS job option: (Name) number-up -- (Value) 9 A job option for custom CUPS filters or backends: (Name) DANKA_watermark -- (Value) Company_Confidential A message to the operator(s): (Name) Deliver_after_completion -- (Value) to_Marketing_Departm. Note: the fields must not include spaces, tabs or quotes. You may need to double-click on a field to edit it. Warning: Do not use CUPS options that can also be controlled through the KDEPrint GUI. Results may be unpredictable if the options conflict, or if they are sent multiple times. For all options supported by the GUI, please use the GUI. (Each GUI element's'What's This' names the related CUPS option name.)

Print queue on remote CUPS server Use this for a print queue installed on a remote machine running a CUPS server. This allows to use remote printers when CUPS browsing is turned off.
Network IPP printer Use this for a network-enabled printer using the IPP protocol. Modern high-end printers can use this mode. Use this mode instead of TCP if your printer can do both.
Fax/ Modem printer Use this for a fax/ modem printer. This requires the installation of the fax4CUPS backend. Documents sent on this printer will be faxed to the given target fax number.
Other printer Use this for any printer type. To use this option, you must know the URI of the printer you want to install. Refer to the CUPS documentation for more information about the printer URI. This option is mainly useful for printer types using 3rd party backends not covered by the other possibilities.
Class of printers Use this to create a class of printers. When sending a document to a class, the document is actually sent to the first available (idle) printer in the class. Refer to the CUPS documentation for more information about class of printers.

Print in Black Only (Blackplot) The'blackplot 'option specifies that all pens should plot in black-only: The default is to use the colors defined in the plot file, or the standard pen colors defined in the HP-GL/ 2 reference manual from Hewlett Packard. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o blackplot=true
Scale Print Image to Page Size The'fitplot 'option specifies that the HP-GL image should be scaled to fill exactly the page with the (elsewhere selected) media size. The default is'fitplot is disabled'. The default will therefore use the absolute distances specified in the plot file. (You should be aware that HP-GL files are very often CAD drawings intended for large format plotters. On standard office printers they will therefore lead to the drawing printout being spread across multiple pages.) Note: This feature depends upon an accurate plot size (PS) command in the HP-GL/ 2 file. If no plot size is given in the file the filter converting the HP-GL to PostScript assumes the plot is ANSI E size. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o fitplot=true
Set Pen Width for HP-GL (if not defined in file). The pen width value can be set here in case the original HP-GL file does not have it set. The pen width specifies the value in micrometers. The default value of 1000 produces lines that are 1000 micrometers == 1 millimeter in width. Specifying a pen width of 0 produces lines that are exactly 1 pixel wide. Note: The pen width option set here is ignored if the pen widths are set inside the plot file itself. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o penwidth=... # example: "2000" or "500"
HP-GL Print Options All options on this page are only applicable if you use KDEPrint to send HP-GL and HP-GL/ 2 files to one of your printers. HP-GL and HP-GL/ 2 are page description languages developed by Hewlett-Packard to drive Pen Plotting devices. KDEPrint can (with the help of CUPS) convert the HP-GL file format and print it on any installed printer. Note 1: To print HP-GL files, start'kprinter 'and simply load the file into the running kprinter. Note 2: The'fitplot' parameter provided on this dialog also works for printing PDF files (if your CUPS version is more recent than 1.1.22.) Additional hint for power users: These KDEPrint GUI elements correspond to the CUPS command line job option parameters: -o blackplot=... # examples: "true" or "false" -o fitplot=... # examples: "true" or "false" -o penwidth=... # examples: "true" or "false"

Brightness: Slider to control the brightness value of all colors used. The brightness value can range from 0 to 200. Values greater than 100 will lighten the print. Values less than 100 will darken the print. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o brightness=... # use range from "0" to "200"
Hue (Tint): Slider to control the hue value for color rotation. The hue value is a number from -360 to 360 and represents the color hue rotation. The following table summarizes the change you will see for the base colors: Original hue=-45 hue=45 Red Purple Yellow-orange Green Yellow-green Blue-green Yellow Orange Green-yellow Blue Sky-blue Purple Magenta Indigo Crimson Cyan Blue-green Light-navy-blue Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o hue=... # use range from "-360" to "360"
Saturation: Slider to control the saturation value for all colors used. The saturation value adjusts the saturation of the colors in an image, similar to the color knob on your television. The color saturation value can range from 0 to 200. On inkjet printers, a higher saturation value uses more ink. On laserjet printers, a higher saturation uses more toner. A color saturation of 0 produces a black-and-white print, while a value of 200 will make the colors extremely intense. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o saturation=... # use range from "0" to "200"
Gamma: Slider to control the gamma value for color correction. The gamma value can range from 1 to 3000. A gamma value greater than 1000 lightens the print. A gamma value less than 1000 darkens the print. The default gamma is 1000. Note: the gamma value adjustment is not visible in the thumbnail preview. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o gamma=... # use range from "1" to "3000"

Options to influence color output of image printouts are: Brightness Hue Saturation Gamma For a more detailed explanation about Brightness, Hue, Saturation and Gamma settings, please look at the'What's This' items provided for these controls.
Coloration Preview Thumbnail The coloration preview thumbnail indicates change of image coloration by different settings. Options to influence output are: Brightness Hue (Tint) Saturation Gamma For a more detailed explanation about Brightness, Hue, Saturation and Gamma settings, please look at the'What's This' items provided for these controls.
Image Size: Drop-down menu to control the image size on the printed paper. The menu works in conjunction with slider below. The options are: Natural Image Size: Image prints in its natural image size. If it does not fit onto one sheet, the printout will be spread across multiple sheets. Note, that the slider is disabled when selecting'natural image size 'in the dropdown menu. Resolution (ppi): The resolution value slider covers a number range from 1 to 1200. It specifies the resolution of the image in Pixels Per Inch (PPI). An image that is 3000x2400 pixels will print 10x8 inches at 300 pixels per inch, for example, but 5x4 inches at 600 pixels per inch. If the specified resolution makes the image larger than the page, multiple pages will be printed. Resolution defaults to 72 ppi.% of Page Size: The percent value slider covers numbers from 1 to 800. It specifies the size in relation to the page (not the image). A scaling of 100 percent will fill the page as completely as the image aspect ratio allows (doing auto-rotation of the image as needed). A scaling of more than 100 will print the image across multiple sheets. A scaling of 200 percent will print on up to 4 pages. Scaling in% of page size defaults to 100%.% of Natural Image Size: The percent value slider moves from 1 to 800. It specifies the printout size in relation to the natural image size. A scaling of 100 percent will print the image at its natural size, while a scaling of 50 percent will print the image at half its natural size. If the specified scaling makes the image larger than the page, multiple pages will be printed. Scaling in% of natural image size defaults to 100%. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o natural-scaling=... # range in% is 1... .800 -o scaling=... # range in% is 1... .800 -o ppi=... # range in ppi is 1... 1200
Position Preview Thumbnail This position preview thumbnail indicates the position of the image on the paper sheet. Click on horizontal and vertical radio buttons to move image alignment on paper around. Options are: center top top-left left bottom-left bottom bottom-right right top-right
Reset to Default Values Reset all coloration settings to default values. Default values are: Brightness: 100 Hue (Tint). 0 Saturation: 100 Gamma: 1000
Image Positioning: Select a pair of radio buttons to move the image to the position you want on the paper printout. Default is'center '. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o position=... # examples: "top-left" or "bottom"

These options will automatically put fonts in the PostScript file which are not present on the printer. Font embedding usually produces better print results (closer to what you see on the screen), but larger print data as well.
When using font embedding you can select additional directories where KDE should search for embeddable font files. By default, the X server font path is used, so adding those directories is not needed. The default search path should be sufficient in most cases.

An identification string. Use only alphanumeric characters except spaces. The string __root__ is reserved for internal use.
A description string. This string is shown in the interface, and should be explicit enough about the role of the corresponding option.
The type of the option. This determines how the option is presented graphically to the user.
The format of the option. This determines how the option is formatted for inclusion in the global command line. The tag %value can be used to represent the user selection. This tag will be replaced at run-time by a string representation of the option value.
The default value of the option. For non persistent options, nothing is added to the command line if the option has that default value. If this value does not correspond to the actual default value of the underlying utility, make the option persistent to avoid unwanted effects.
Make the option persistent. A persistent option is always written to the command line, whatever its value. This is useful when the chosen default value does not match with the actual default value of the underlying utility.
The full command line to execute the associated underlying utility. This command line is based on a mechanism of tags that are replaced at run-time. The supported tags are: %filterargs: command options %filterinput: input specification %filteroutput: output specification %psu: the page size in upper case %psl: the page size in lower case
Input specification when the underlying utility reads input data from a file. Use the tag %in to represent the input filename.
Output specification when the underlying utility writes output data to a file. Use the tag %out to represent the output filename.
Input specification when the underlying utility reads input data from its standard input.
Output specification when the underlying utility writes output data to its standard output.
A comment about the underlying utility, which can be viewed by the user from the interface. This comment string supports basic HTML tags like & lt; agt;, & lt; bgt; or & lt; igt;.

Configuring %1
Add File button This button calls the'File Open 'dialog to let you select a file for printing. Note, that you can select ASCII or International Text, PDF, PostScript, JPEG, TIFF, PNG, GIF and many other graphic formats. you can select various files from different paths and send them as one "multi-file job" to the printing system.
Remove File button This button removes the highlighted file from the list of to-be-printed files.
Move File Up button This button moves the highlighted file up in the list of files to be printed. In effect, this changes the order of the files' printout.
Move File Down button This button moves the highlighted file down in the list of files to be printed. In effect, this changes the order of the files' printout.
File Open button This button tries to open the highlighted file, so you can view or edit it before you send it to the printing system. If you open files, KDEPrint will use the application matching the MIME type of the file.
File List view This list displays all the files you selected for printing. You can see the file name(s), file path(s) and the file (MIME) type(s) as determined by KDEPrint. You may re-arrange the initial order of the list with the help of the arrow buttons on the right. The files will be printed as a single job, in the same order as displayed in the list. Note: You can select multiple files. The files may be in multiple locations. The files may be of multiple MIME types. The buttons on the right side let you add more files, remove already selected files from the list, re-order the list (by moving files up or down), and open files. If you open files, KDEPrint will use the application matching the MIME type of the file.

List of Driver Options (from PPD). The upper pane of this dialog page contains all print job options as laid down in the printer's description file (PostScript Printer Description == 'PPD '.) Click on any item in the list and watch the lower pane of this dialog page display the available values. Set the values as needed, then use one of the push buttons below to proceed: 'Save' your settings if you want to re-use them in your next job(s) too. 'Save 'will store your settings permanently until you change them again.. Click'OK' (without a prior click on'Save '), if you want to use your selected settings just once, for the next print job. 'OK' will forget your current settings when kprinter is closed again, and will start next time with the previously saved defaults. 'Cancel 'will not change anything. If you proceed to print after clicking'Cancel', the job will print with the default settings of this queue. Note. The number of available job options depends strongly on the actual driver used for your print queue. 'Raw 'queues do not have a driver or a PPD. For raw queues this tab page is not loaded by KDEPrint, and thus is not present in the kprinter dialog.

"General" This dialog page contains general print job settings. General settings are applicable to most printers, most jobs and most job file types. To get more specific help, enable the "What's This" cursor and click on any of the text labels or GUI elements of this dialog.
Page size: Select paper size to be printed on from the drop-down menu. The exact list of choices depends on the printer driver ("PPD") you have installed. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element correponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o PageSize=... # examples: "A4" or "Letter"
Paper type: Select paper type to be printed on from the drop-down menu. The exact list of choices depends on the printer driver ("PPD") you have installed. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o MediaType=... # example: "Transparency"
Paper source: Select paper source tray for the paper to be printed on from the drop-down menu. The exact list of choices depends on the printer driver ("PPD") you have installed. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o InputSlot=... # examples: "Lower" or "LargeCapacity"
Image Orientation: Orientation of the printed page image on your paper is controlled by the radio buttons. By default, the orientation is Portrait. You can select from 4 alternatives: Portrait. Portrait is the default setting. Landscape. Reverse Landscape. Reverse Landscape prints the images upside down. Reverse Portrait. Reverse Portrait prints the image upside down. The icon changes according to your selection. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o orientation-requested=... # examples: "landscape" or "reverse-portrait"
Duplex Printing: These controls may be grayed out if your printer does not support duplex printing (i. e. printing on both sides of the sheet.) These controls are active if your printer supports duplex printing. You can choose from 3 alternatives: None. This prints each page of the job on one side of the sheets only. Long Side. This prints the job on both sides of the paper sheets. It prints the job in a way so that the backside has the same orientation as the front side if you fold the paper over the long edge. (Some printer drivers call this mode duplex-non-tumbled.) Short Side. This prints the job on both sides of the paper sheets. It prints the job so that the backside has the reverse orientation from the front side if you turn the paper over the long edge, but the same orientation, if you turn it over the short edge. (Some printer drivers name this mode duplex-tumbled.) Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o duplex=... # examples: "tumble" or "two-sided-short-edge"
Banner Page(s): Select banner(s) to print one or two special sheets of paper just before or after your main job. Banners may contain some pieces of job information such as user name, time of printing or job title. Banner pages are useful to separate different jobs more easily, especially in a multi-user environment. Hint: You can design your own banner pages. To make use of them, just put the banner file into the standard CUPS banners directory (this is usually "/ usr/ share/ cups/ banner/". Your custom banner(s) must have one of the supported printable formats. Supported formats are ASCII text, PostScript, PDF and nearly any image format such as PNG, JPEG or GIF. Your added banner pages will appear in the drop down menu CUPS is restarted. CUPS comes with a selection of banner pages. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o job-sheets=... # examples: "standard" or "topsecret"
Pages per Sheet: You can choose to print more than one page onto each sheet of paper. This is sometimes useful to save paper. Note 1: the page images get scaled down accordingly to print 2 or 4 pages per sheet. The page image does not get scaled if you print 1 page per sheet (the default setting). Note 2: If you select multiple pages per sheet here, the scaling and re-arranging is done by your printing system. However, some printers are independently capable of printing multiple pages per sheet. In which case you find the option in the printer driver settings. Be careful: if you enable multiple pages per sheet in both places, your printout will not look as you intended. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o number-up=... # examples: "2" or "4"

Current Page: Select "Current" if you want to print the page currently visible in your KDE application. Note: this field is disabled if you print from non-KDE applications like Mozilla or OpenOffice. org, since here KDEPrint has no means to determine which document page you are currently viewing.
Page Range: Choose a "Page Range" to select a subset of the complete document pages to be printed. The format is "n, m, o-p, q, r, s-t, u". Example: "4,6,10-13,17,20,23-25" will print the pages 4, 6, 10, 11, 12, 13, 17, 20, 23, 24, 25 of your document. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o page-ranges=... # example: "4,6,10-13,17,20,23-25"
Page Set: Choose "All Pages", "Even Pages" or "Odd Pages" if you want to print a page selection matching one of these terms. The default is "All Pages". Note: If you combine a selection of a "Page Range" with a "Page Set" of "Odd" or "Even", you will only get the odd or even pages from the originally selected page range. This is useful if you want to print a page range in duplex on a simplex-only printer. In this case you can feed the paper to the printer twice; in the first pass, select "Odd" or "Even" (depending on your printer model), in second pass select the other option. You may need to "Reverse" the output in one of the passes (depending on your printer model). Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o page-set=... # example: "odd" or "even"
Output Settings: Here you can determine the number of copies, the output order and the collate mode for the pages of your print job. (Note, that the maximum number of copies allowed to print may be restricted by your print subsystem.) The'Copies' setting defaults to 1. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o copies=... # examples: "5" or "42" -o outputorder=... # example: "reverse" -o Collate=... # example: "true" or "false".
Number of Copies: Determine the number of requested copies here. You can increase or decrease the number of printed copies by clicking on the up and down arrows. You can also type the figure directly into the box. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o copies=... # examples: "5" or "42"
Collate Copies If the "Collate" checkbox is enabled (default), the output order for multiple copies of a multi-page document will be "1-2-3-..., 1-2-3-..., 1-2-3-...". If the "Collate" checkbox is disabled, the output order for multiple copies of a multi-page document will be "1-1-1-..., 2-2-2-..., 3-3-3-...". Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o Collate=... # example: "true" or "false"
Reverse Order If the "Reverse" checkbox is enabled, the output order for multiple copies of a multi-page document will be "... -3-2-1,... -3-2-1,... -3-2-1", if you also have en abled the "Collate" checkbox at the same time (the usual scenario). If the "Reverse" checkbox is enabled, the output order for multiple copies of a multi-page document will be "... -3-3-3,... -2-2-2,... -1-1-1", if you have dis abled the "Collate" checkbox at the same time. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS commandline job option parameter: -o outputorder=... # example: "reverse"

Top Margin. This spinbox/ text edit field lets you control the top margin of your printout if the printing application does not define its margins internally. The setting works for instance for ASCII text file printing, or for printing from KMail and Konqueror. Note: This margin setting is not intended for KOffice or OpenOffice. org printing, because these applications (or rather their users) are expected to do it by themselves. It also does not work for PostScript or PDF file, which in most cases have their margins hardcoded internally. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o page-top=... # use values from "0" or higher. "72" is equal to 1 inch.
Bottom Margin. This spinbox/ text edit field lets you control the bottom margin of your printout if the printing application does not define its margins internally. The setting works for instance for ASCII text file printing, or for printing from KMail and and Konqueror. Note: This margin setting is not intended for KOffice or OpenOffice. org printing, because these applications (or rather their users) are expected to do it by themselves. It also does not work for PostScript or PDF file, which in most cases have their margins hardcoded internally. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o page-bottom=... # use values from "0" or higher. "72" is equal to 1 inch.
Left Margin. This spinbox/ text edit field lets you control the left margin of your printout if the printing application does not define its margins internally. The setting works for instance for ASCII text file printing, or for printing from KMail and and Konqueror. Note: This margin setting is not intended for KOffice or OpenOffice. org printing, because these applications (or rather their users) are expected to do it by themselves. It also does not work for PostScript or PDF file, which in most cases have their margins hardcoded internally. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o page-left=... # use values from "0" or higher. "72" is equal to 1 inch.
Right Margin. This spinbox/ text edit field lets you control the right margin of your printout if the printing application does not define its margins internally. The setting works for instance for ASCII text file printing, or for printing from KMail and and Konqueror. Note: This margin setting is not intended for KOffice or OpenOffice. org printing, because these applications (or rather their users) are expected to do it by themselves. It also does not work for PostScript or PDF file, which in most cases have their margins hardcoded internally. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o page-right=... # use values from "0" or higher. "72" is equal to 1 inch.
Change Measurement Unit. You can change the units of measurement for the page margins here. Select from Millimeters, Centimeters, Inches or Pixels (1 pixel == 1/ 72 inch.)
Custom Margins Checkbox. Enable this checkbox if you want to modify the margins of your printouts. You can change margin settings in 4 ways: Edit the text fields. Click spinbox arrows. Move the scroll wheel of a wheel mouse. Use the mouse to drag margins in the preview frame. Note: The margin setting does not work if you load files into kprinter which have their margins hardcoded internally, such as most PDF or PostScript files. It works for all ASCII text files however. It also may not work with non-KDE applications which fail to fully utilize the KDEPrint framework, such as OpenOffice. org.

You are about to set a pseudo-printer as your personal default. This setting is specific to KDE and will not be available outside KDE applications. Note that this will only make your personal default printer as undefined for non-KDE applications and should not prevent you from printing normally. Do you really want to set %1 as your personal default?

Print Poster (enabled or disabled). If you enable this option, you can print posters of different sizes The printout will happen in the form'tiles' printed on smaller paper sizes, which you can stitch together later. If you enable this option here, the'Poster Printing 'filter will be auto-loaded in the'Filters' tab of this dialog. This tab is only visible if the external'poster 'utility is discovered by KDEPrint on your system. ['poster' is a command line utility that enables you to convert PostScript files into tiled printouts, with overlap to allow the tiles to be joined together seamlessly.] Note: The standard version of'poster 'will not work. Your system must use a patched version of'poster'. Ask your operating system vendor to provide a patched version of'poster 'if they do not do so already. Additional hint for power users: A patched version of'poster' is available from the KDEPrint Website at http: / /printing. kde. org/ downloads/. The direct link to the patched source tarball is ftp: / /ftp. kde. org/ pub/ kde/ printing/ poster. tar. bz2
Tile Selection widget This GUI element is not only for viewing your selections: it also lets you interactively select the tile(s) you want to print. Hints Click any tile to select it for printing. To select multiple tiles to be printed at once, 'shift-click 'on the tiles ('shift-click' means: hold down the [SHIFT]-key on your keyboard and click with the mouse while [SHIFT]-key is held.) Be aware that the order of your clicking dictates the order in which the different tiles are printed. Note 1: The order of your selection (and the order for printout of the tiles) is indicated by the contents of the text field below, labelled as'Tile pages (to be printed): 'Note 2: By default, no tiles are selected. Before you can print (a part of) your poster, you must select at least one tile.
Poster Size Select the poster size you want from the drop-down list. Available sizes are all standard paper sizes up to'A0 '. [A0 is the same size as 16 sheets of A4, or '84cm x 118.2cm'.] Notice, how the little preview window below changes with your change of poster size. It indicates to you how many tiles need to be printed to make the poster, given the selected paper size. Hint: The little preview window below is not just a passive icon. You can click on its individual tiles to select them for printing. To select multiple tiles to be printed at once, you need to'shift-click 'on the tiles ('shift-click' means: hold down the [SHIFT]-key on your keyboard and click with the mouse while [SHIFT]-key is held.) The order in which you click dictates the order in which the tiles are printed. The order of your selection (and of the printed tiles) is indicated by the contents of the text field labelled as'Tile pages (to be printed): 'Note: By default, no tiles are selected. Before you can print (a part of) your poster, you must select at least one tile.
Paper Size This field indicates the paper size the poster tiles will be printed on. To select a different paper size for your poster tiles, go to the'General 'tab of this dialog and select one from the drop-down list. Available sizes are most standard paper sizes supported by your printer. Your printer's supported paper sizes are read from the printer driver info (as laid down in the'PPD', the printer description file.) Be aware that the'Paper Size 'selected may not be supported by'poster' (example: 'HalfLetter ') while it may well be supported by your printer. If you hit that obstacle, simply use another, supported Paper Size, such as'A4' or'Letter '. Notice, how the little preview window below changes with your change of paper size. It indicates how many tiles need to be printed to make up the poster, given the selected paper and poster size. Hint: The little preview window below is not just a passive icon. You can click on its individual tiles to select them for printing. To select multiple tiles to be printed at once, you need to'shift-click' on the tiles ('shift-click 'means: hold down the [SHIFT]-key on your keyboard and click with the mouse while [SHIFT]-key is held.) The order in which you click dictates the order in which the tiles are printed. The order of your selection (and for the printed tiles) is indicated by the contents of the text field labelled as'Tile pages (to be printed):' Note: By default, no tiles are selected. Before you can print (a part of) your poster, you must select at least one tile.
Cut Margin selection This slider and spinbox let you determine a'cut margin 'to be printed onto each tile of your poster, to help you cut the pieces as needed. Notice, how the little preview window above changes with your change of cut margins. It indicates to you how much space the cut margins will take away from each tile. Be aware, that your cut margins need to be equal to or greater than the margins your printer uses. The printer's capabilities are described in the'ImageableArea' keywords of its driver PPD file.
Order and number of tile pages to be printed. This field displays and sets the individual tiles to be printed, as well as the order for their printout. You can fill the field with 2 different methods: either use the interactive thumbnail preview above and '[SHIFT]-click 'on the tiles; or, edit this text field accordingly. When editing the field, you can denote ranges of pages with, for instance, '3-7', rather than '3,4,5,6,7 '. Examples: "2,3,7,9,3" "1-3,6,8-11"

Add Filter button This button calls a little dialog to let you select a filter here. Note 1: You can chain different filters as long as you make sure that the output of one fits as input of the next. (KDEPrint checks your filtering chain and will warn you if you fail to do so). Note 2: The filters you define here are applied to your jobfile before it is handed downstream to your spooler and print subsystem (e. g. CUPS, LPRng, LPD.)
Remove Filter button This button removes the highlighted filter from the list of filters.
Move Filter Up button This button moves the highlighted filter up in the list of filters, towards the front of the filtering chain.
Move Filter Down button This button moves the highlighted filter down in the list of filters, towards the end of the filtering chain..
Configure Filter button This button lets you configure the currently highlighted filter. It opens a separate dialog.
Filter Info Pane This field shows some general info about the selected filter. Amongst them are: the filter name (as displayed in the KDEPrint user interface); the filter requirements (that is the external program that needs to be present and executable on this system); the filter input format (in the form of one or several MIME types accepted by the filter); the filter output format (in the form of a MIME type generated by the filter); a more- or less-verbose description of the filter's operation.
Filtering Chain (if enabled, is run before actual job submission to print system.) This field shows which filters are currently selected to act as'pre-filters' for KDEPrint. Pre-filters process the print files before they are sent down-stream to your real print subsystem. The list shown in this field may be empty (default). The pre-filters act on the print job in the order they are listed (from top to bottom). This is done by acting as a filtering chain where the output of one filter acts as input to the next. By putting the filters into the wrong order, you can make the filtering chain fail. For example: if your file is ASCII text, and you want the output being processed by the'Multipage per Sheet 'filter, the first filter must be one that converts ASCII into PostScript. KDEPrint can utilize any external filtering program which you may find useful through this interface. KDEPrint ships preconfigured with support for a selection of common filters. These filters however need to be installed independently from KDEPrint. These pre-filters work for all print subsystems supported by KDEPrint (such as CUPS, LPRng and LPD), because they are not dependent upon them.. Amongst the pre-configured filters shipping with KDEPrint are: the Enscript text filter; a Multiple Pages per Sheet filter; a PostScript to PDF converter; a Page Selection/ Ordering filter; a Poster Printing filter; and some more.... To insert a filter into this list, simply click on the funnel icon (top-most on the right icon column group) and proceed. Please click on the other elements of this dialog to learn more about the KDEPrint pre-filters.

Input
Selection of color mode: You can choose between 2 options: Color and Grayscale Note: This selection field may be grayed out and made inactive. This happens if KDEPrint can not retrieve enough information about your print file. In this case the embedded color- or grayscale information of your printfile, and the default handling of the printer take precedence.
Selection of page size: Select the paper size to be printed on from the drop-down menu. The exact list of choices depends on the printer driver ("PPD") you have installed.
Selection of pages per sheet: You can choose to print more than one page onto each sheet of paper. This is sometimes useful to save paper. Note 1: the page images get scaled down accordingly to print 2 or 4 pages per sheet. The page image does not get scaled if you print 1 page per sheet (the default setting.). Note 2: If you select multiple pages per sheet here, the scaling and re-arranging is done by your printing system. Note 3, regarding "Other": You cannot really select Other as the number of pages to print on one sheet. "Other" is listed here for information purposes only. To select 8, 9, 16 or other numbers of pages per sheet: go to the tab headlined "Filter"; enable the Multiple Pages per Sheet filter;... and configure it (bottom-most button on the right of the "Filters" tab).
Selection of image orientation: Orientation of the printed page image on your paper is controlled by these radio buttons. By default, the orientation is Portrait. You can select 2 alternatives: Portrait., the default setting; Landscape.. The icon changes according to your selection.
