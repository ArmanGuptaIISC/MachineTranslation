Because of the FOSH aims of RepRap, many related projects have used their design for inspiration, creating an ecosystem of related or derivative 3D printers, most of which are also open source designs.
The availability of these open source designs means that variants of 3D printers are easy to invent.
The quality and complexity of printer designs, however, as well as the quality of kit or finished products, varies greatly from project to project.
This rapid development of open source 3D printers is gaining interest in many spheres as it enables hyper-customization and the use of public domain designs to fabricate open source appropriate technology.
This technology can also assist initiatives in sustainable development since technologies are easily and economically made from resources available to local communities.

On 9 September 1964, the East German Council of Ministers (government) decided to allow Eastern pensioners to visit family in West Germany or West Berlin.
According to the specified regulations valid from 2 November on Eastern pensioners could apply, and were usually allowed, to travel into the West to visit relatives once a year for a maximum of four weeks.
If pensioners decided not to return, the government did not miss them as manpower, unlike younger Easterners, who were subject to a system of labour and employment, which demanded almost everybody work in the Eastern command production system.
The five marks had to be spent, as exporting Eastern currency was illegal, which is why importing it after having bargained for it at the currency market at Zoo station was also illegal.
Western pensioners and children were spared from the compulsory exchange (officially in , i.e.
The following year, 1965, East Germany opened the travelling season for West Berliners on 18 December.
After ratification of the Agreement and specifying the pertaining regulations West Berliners could apply for the first time again for visas for any chosen date to East Berlin or East Germany from 3 October 1972 onwards.
West Berliners were now spared the visa fee of 5 Western Deutsche Marks, not to be confused with the compulsory exchange amounting to the same sum, but yielding in return 5 Eastern marks.
This financial relief did not last long, because on 15 November 1973 East Germany doubled the compulsory exchange to 10 Eastern marks, payable in West German Deutsche Marks at par.
One-day-visas for East Berlin were now issued in a fast procedure on entering East Berlin; visas for longer stays and visas for East Germany proper needed a prior application, which could be a lengthy procedure.
They accepted visa applications and handed out confirmed visas issued in the East, to the West Berlin applicants.
The disagreement about Berlin's status was one of the most important debates of the Cold War.
Sewer pipes, however, once discovered as a way to flee the East, were blocked by bars.
West Berlin paid for the treatment of its sewage in Western Deutsche Marks which were desperately needed by the Eastern government.
Since the methods used in the East did not meet Western standards, West Berlin increased the capacity of modern sewage treatment within its own territory, so that the amount of its sewage treated in the East had considerably reduced by the time the Wall came down.
Similar was the situation with refuse.
Later a second dump, further away, was opened in Vorketzin, a part of Ketzin.
As for the S-Bahn, operated in all of Berlin by the East German Reichsbahn, the construction of the Wall meant a deep cut into its integrated network of lines, especially for Berlin's circular S-Bahn line around all of the Western and Eastern inner city.
The lines were separated and those mostly located in West Berlin were continued, but only accessible from West Berlin with all access in East Berlin closed.
For West Berliners and West Germans the opening of the border for free entry lasted longer.
Finally on 22 December 1989 East Germany granted West Berliners and West Germans free entry without charge at the existing checkpoints, demanding only valid papers.
The total area is 56.81 km².

Melanophryne carpish is a rare and little-known species of microhylid frog endemic to Peru.
It lacks eardrums, and at a cursory glance it resembles leptodactylid frogs of the genus "Phrynopus" where it was initially placed.
It also has no tympanic annulus and stapes, making it probably extremely hard of hearing.
It is almost extinct due to habitat destruction.

Terina is a brand name used by the Norwegian meat processing company Nortura on its frozen and canned food.
The production uses raw products from Gilde but is processed through the subsidiary Terina AS.
There are processing plants in Namsos, Tynset, Sogndal and Lillehammer.
Annual production was 17,000 tonnes with a revenue of NOK 1.4 billion and 300 employees in 2005.
Until 2006 the brand was managed by the agricultural cooperative Gilde Norsk Kjøtt who then merged with Prior Norge to form Nortura.
The brand was first used in Northern Norway by the local meat cooperatives, and became a national brand in 1964.

Busan Metro Line 1 is the north-south route of the Busan Metro.
It does not transit its star, implying that its inclination is less than 88.1 degrees.
It is rather close to Gliese 581 and completes a full orbit in only 5.4 days at a mean distance of about 6 million kilometres (0.041 AU).
By comparison, Mercury is at a distance of 58 million kilometres (0.387 AU) and completes an orbit in 88 days.
It is likely close to Gliese 436 b in mass, temperature, and (with Gliese 876 d) susceptibility to solar effects such as coronal mass ejection.
Since Gliese 581 b does not transit, nothing more can be said of it yet.
At the least, given that Gliese 581 b orbits alongside two other planets (Gliese 581 c and e) and that Gliese 436 b (thus far) stands alone, their formation must have differed.

Focuses on Kahn's role in the development of computer networking from 1967 through the early 1980s.
Beginning with his work at Bolt Beranek and Newman (BBN), Kahn discusses his involvement as the ARPANET proposal was being written, his decision to become active in its implementation, and his role in the public demonstration of the ARPANET.
The interview continues into Kahn's involvement with networking when he moves to IPTO in 1972, where he was responsible for the administrative and technical evolution of the ARPANET, including programs in packet radio, the development of a new network protocol (TCP/IP), and the switch to TCP/IP to connect multiple networks.

The larvae form a typical leaf cone.
It is known from Puerto Rico and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.
The mine has the form of a short linear mine, ending in a small blotch with either the upper or lower epidermis loosened.
Later, the leaf is rolled downwards, first from one side, then from the other, and then from the tip.
The mine occurs on the upper surface of the leaf.
It starts long-linear, epidermal and running along the leaf vein or leaf margin, thereupon it broadens into an elongate blotch, usually located along the leaf margin and tentiformed and sometimes completely folded upwardly.
The cocoon is found at a position separated from the mine.
In rearing condition it was found at the tip or margin of the mining leaf.
It is boat-shaped and whitish.
The mine starts as an underside tentiform mine that resembles the mine of "Phyllonorycter" species.
Later instars (in most cases) roll an entire leaf evenly lengthwise, although some individuals do roll a transverse cone as is typical for the genus.

Variability in test scores can be produced by small changes in the testing environment.
For example, test-takers will usually remain on task for longer periods of time if the examiner is visibly present in the room than if the examiner is absent.
==Research==In an early study of the influence of temperament on attention span, the mothers of 232 pairs of twins were interviewed periodically about the similarities and differences in behavior displayed by their twins during infancy and early childhood.
The results showed that each of the behavioral variables (temper frequency, temper intensity, irritability, crying, and demanding attention) had a significant inverse relationship with attention span.
In other words, the twin with longer attention span was better able to remain absorbed in a particular activity without distraction, and was also the less temperamental twin.
One study of 2600 children found that early exposure to television (around age two) is associated with later attention problems such as inattention, impulsiveness, disorganization, and distractibility at age seven.
This correlational study does not specify whether viewing television increases attention problems in children, or if children who are naturally prone to inattention are disproportionately attracted to the stimulation of television at young ages, or if there is some other factor, such as parenting skills, associated with this finding.
How well a parent can capture and keep a two-year-old's attention on a toy may be more important than just a pleasant way to pass the time.
"We found that children whose parents actively directed and maintained their child's visual attention spent more time distracting themselves away from a source of distress."
In one study, Raver observed 47 urban low-income mothers and their two-year-olds for ten minutes of free play, analyzing how much the pair kept each other's attention.
The mother then left the room for four minutes and trained observers noted how the child managed his/her emotions.
After the mother returned, the experimenter placed a new toy out of reach of the child, stating that the child could have it in a few minutes after the experimenter returned to the room.
"Both strategies were effective for delaying gratification, maintaining behavioral self-control and modulating feelings of distress," said Raver.

Such a definition has the advantage that it is easier to include all species with a certain morphology.
Ketchum and Benson (2010) also coined a new clade Neoplesiosauria, a node-based taxon that was defined by as "Plesiosaurus dolichodeirus", "Pliosaurus brachydeirus", their most recent common ancestor and all of its descendants".
Neoplesiosauria very likely is materially identical to Plesiosauria "sensu" Druckenmiller & Russell and was meant to be a replacement of this concept.
The following cladogram follows an analysis by Ketchum & Benson, 2011.
Rhomaleosauridae was found to be outside Neoplesiosauria, but still within Plesiosauria.
However, the authors excluded "Bobosaurus" from this clade without any explanation, although that exclusion might be a typo in the article.
This analysis focused on basal plesiosaurs and therefore only one derived pliosaurid and one cryptoclidian were included, while elasmosaurids weren't included at all.
The cladogram below follows the topology from Benson et al.

The initial model was advanced by Ernest Tupes and Raymond Christal in 1961 but failed to reach an academic audience until the 1980s.
In 1990, J.M.
Digman advanced his five-factor model of personality, which Lewis Goldberg extended to the highest level of organization.
These five overarching domains have been found to contain and subsume most known personality traits and are assumed to represent the basic structure behind all personality traits.
These five factors provide a rich conceptual framework for integrating all the research findings and theory in personality psychology.
At least four sets of researchers have worked independently for decades on this problem and have identified generally the same five factors: Tupes and Cristal were first, followed by Goldberg at the Oregon Research Institute, Cattell at the University of Illinois, and Costa and McCrae at the National Institutes of Health.
These four sets of researchers used somewhat different methods in finding the five traits, and thus each set of five factors has somewhat different names and definitions.
However, all have been found to be highly inter-correlated and factor-analytically aligned.
Studies indicate that the Big Five traits are not nearly as powerful in predicting and explaining actual behavior as are the more numerous facet or primary traits.
Each of the Big Five personality traits contains two separate, but correlated, aspects reflecting a level of personality below the broad domains but above the many facet scales that are also part of the Big Five.
The aspects are labeled as follows: Volatility and Withdrawal for Neuroticism; Enthusiasm and Assertiveness for Extroversion; Intellect and Openness for Openness/Intellect; Industriousness and Orderliness for Conscientiousness; and Compassion and Politeness for Agreeableness.
People who are open to experience are intellectually curious, open to emotion, sensitive to beauty and willing to try new things.
They tend to be, when compared to closed people, more creative and more aware of their feelings.
They are also more likely to hold unconventional beliefs.
A particular individual, however, may have a high overall openness score and be interested in learning and exploring new cultures but have no great interest in art or poetry.
There is a strong connection between liberal ethics and openness to experience such as support for policies endorsing racial tolerance.
Another characteristic of the open cognitive style is a facility for thinking in symbols and abstractions far removed from concrete experience.
People with low scores on openness tend to have more conventional, traditional interests.
They prefer the plain, straightforward, and obvious over the complex, ambiguous, and subtle.
They may regard the arts and sciences with suspicion or view these endeavors as uninteresting.
Closed people prefer familiarity over novelty; they are conservative and resistant to change.
The trait is marked by pronounced engagement with the external world.
Extraverts enjoy interacting with people, and are often perceived as full of energy.
They tend to be enthusiastic, action-oriented individuals.
They possess high group visibility, like to talk, and assert themselves.
Introverts have lower social engagement and energy levels than extraverts.
They tend to seem quiet, low-key, deliberate, and less involved in the social world.
Their lack of social involvement should not be interpreted as shyness or depression; instead they are more independent of their social world than extraverts.
Introverts need less stimulation than extraverts and more time alone.
This does not mean that they are unfriendly or antisocial; rather, they are reserved in social situations.
====Sample items====* I am the life of the party.
Agreeable individuals value getting along with others.
They are generally considerate, kind, generous, trusting and trustworthy, helpful, and willing to compromise their interests with others.
Agreeable people also have an optimistic view of human nature.
Because agreeableness is a social trait, research has shown that one's agreeableness positively correlates with the quality of relationships with one's team members.
Agreeableness also positively predicts transformational leadership skills.
In a study conducted among 169 participants in leadership positions in a variety of professions, individuals were asked to take a personality test and have two evaluations completed by directly supervised subordinates.
Leaders with high levels of agreeableness were more likely to be considered transformational rather than transactional.
However, the same study showed no predictive power of leadership effectiveness as evaluated by the leader's direct supervisor.
Agreeableness, however, has been found to be negatively related to transactional leadership in the military.
A study of Asian military units showed leaders with a high level of agreeableness to be more likely to receive a low rating for transformational leadership skills.
Therefore, with further research organizations may be able to determine an individual's potential for performance based on their personality traits.
Disagreeable individuals place self-interest above getting along with others.
They are generally unconcerned with others' well-being, and are less likely to extend themselves for other people.
Sometimes their skepticism about others' motives causes them to be suspicious, unfriendly, and uncooperative.
It is sometimes called emotional instability, or is reversed and referred to as emotional stability.
According to Eysenck's (1967) theory of personality, neuroticism is interlinked with low tolerance for stress or aversive stimuli.
Those who score high in neuroticism are emotionally reactive and vulnerable to stress.
They are more likely to interpret ordinary situations as threatening, and minor frustrations as hopelessly difficult.
Their negative emotional reactions tend to persist for unusually long periods of time, which means they are often in a bad mood.
For instance, neuroticism is connected to a pessimistic approach toward work, confidence that work impedes personal relationships, and apparent anxiety linked with work.
Furthermore, those who score high on neuroticism may display more skin conductance reactivity than those who score low on neuroticism.
These problems in emotional regulation can diminish the ability of a person scoring high on neuroticism to think clearly, make decisions, and cope effectively with stress.
Lacking contentment in one's life achievements can correlate with high neuroticism scores and increase one's likelihood of falling into clinical depression.
Moreover, individuals high on neuroticism tend to experience more negative life events, but neuroticism also changes in response to positive and negative life experiences.
At the other end of the scale, individuals who score low in neuroticism are less easily upset and are less emotionally reactive.
They tend to be calm, emotionally stable, and free from persistent negative feelings.
Freedom from negative feelings does not mean that low scorers experience a lot of positive feelings.
Neuroticism is similar but not identical to being neurotic in the Freudian sense (i.e.
neurosis.)
Some psychologists prefer to call neuroticism by the term emotional stability to differentiate it from the term neurotic in a career test.
In 1936 Gordon Allport and S. Odbert put Sir Francis Galton’s hypothesis into practice by extracting 4,504 adjectives which they believed were descriptive of observable and relatively permanent traits from the dictionaries at that time.
In 1940, Raymond Cattell retained the adjectives, and eliminated synonyms to reduce the total to 171.
He constructed a personality test for the clusters of personality traits he found from the adjectives, called Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire.
Then, in 1961, Ernest Tupes and Raymond Christal found five recurring factors from this 16PF Questionnaire.
This work was replicated by Warren Norman, who also found that five major factors were sufficient to account for a large set of personality data.
Norman named these factors surgency, agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability, and culture; and these factors are through which five factor consensus has grown.
===Hiatus in research===For the next two decades, the changing zeitgeist made publication of personality research difficult.
In his 1968 book "Personality and Assessment", Walter Mischel asserted that personality tests could not predict behavior with a correlation of more than 0.3.
Social psychologists like Mischel argued that attitudes and behavior were not stable, but varied with the situation.
Predicting behavior by personality tests was considered to be impossible.
Emerging methodologies challenged this point of view during the 1980s.
Instead of trying to predict single instances of behavior, which was unreliable, researchers found that they could predict patterns of behavior by aggregating large numbers of observations.
As a result, correlations between personality and behavior increased substantially, and it was clear that "personality" did in fact exist.
Personality and social psychologists now generally agree that both personal and situational variables are needed to account for human behavior.
Trait theories became justified, and there was a resurgence of interest in this area.
By 1980, the pioneering research by Tupes, Christal, and Norman had been largely forgotten by psychologists.
Lewis Goldberg started his own lexical project, independently found the five factors once again, and gradually brought them back to the attention of psychologists.
He later coined the term "Big Five" as a label for the factors.
===Renewed attention===In a 1980 symposium in Honolulu, four prominent researchers, Lewis Goldberg, Naomi Takemoto-Chock, Andrew Comrey, and John M. Digman, reviewed the available personality tests of the day.
They concluded that the tests which held the most promise measured a subset of five common factors, just as Norman had discovered in 1963.
This event was followed by widespread acceptance of the five-factor model among personality researchers during the 1980s.Peter Saville and his team included the five-factor "Pentagon" model with the original OPQ in 1984.
Pentagon was closely followed by the NEO five-factor personality inventory, published by Costa and McCrae in 1985.
==Biological and developmental factors=====Heritability===Twin studies suggest that heritability and environmental factors equally influence all five factors to the same degree.
Among four recent twin studies, the mean percentage for heritability was calculated for each personality and it was concluded that heritability influenced the five factors broadly.
The self-report measures were as follows: openness to experience was estimated to have a 57% genetic influence, extraversion 54%, conscientiousness 49%, neuroticism 48%, and agreeableness 42%.
===Development of the Big Five during childhood and adolescence===Research on the Big Five, and personality in general, has focused primarily on individual differences in adulthood, rather than in childhood and adolescence.
Yet, recent studies have begun to explore the developmental origins and trajectories of the Big Five among children and adolescents.
Contrary to some researchers who question whether children have stable personality traits, Big Five or otherwise, most researchers contend that there are significant psychological differences between children that are associated with relatively stable, distinct, and salient behavior patterns.
Some of these differences are evident at, if not before, birth.
For example, both parents and researchers recognize that some newborn infants are peaceful and easily soothed while others are comparatively fussy and hard to calm.
Although developmental psychologists generally interpret individual differences in children as evidence of temperament rather than personality traits, some researchers argue that temperaments and personality traits are age-specific manifestations of virtually the same latent qualities.
Alternatively, early childhood temperaments may become adolescent and adult personality traits as individuals' basic genetic characteristics actively, reactively, and passively interact with their changing environments.
The structure, manifestations, and development of the Big Five in childhood and adolescence has been studied using a variety of methods, including parent- and teacher-ratings, preadolescent and adolescent self- and peer-ratings, and observations of parent-child interactions.
Results from these studies support the relative stability of personality traits across the human lifespan, at least from preschool age through adulthood.
More specifically, research suggests that four of the Big Five –namely Extraversion, Neuroticism, Conscientiousness, and Agreeableness- reliably describe personality differences in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood.
However, some evidence suggests that Openness may not be a fundamental, stable part of childhood personality.
Although some researchers have found that Openness in children and adolescents relates to attributes such as creativity, curiosity, imagination, and intellect, many researchers have failed to find distinct individual differences in Openness in childhood and early adolescence.
Potentially, Openness may (a) manifest in unique, currently unknown ways in childhood or (b) may only manifest as children develop socially and cognitively.
Other studies have found evidence for all of the Big Five traits in childhood and adolescence as well as two other child-specific traits: Irritability and Activity.
Despite these specific differences, the majority of findings suggest that personality traits –particularly Extraversion, Neuroticism, Conscientiousness, and Agreeableness- are evident in childhood and adolescence and are associated with distinct social-emotional patterns of behavior that are largely consistent with adult manifestations of those same personality traits.
====Extraversion/Positive Emotionality====In Big Five studies, Extraversion has been associated with surgency.
Children with high Extraversion are energetic, talkative, social, and dominant with children and adults; whereas, children with low Extraversion tend to be quiet, calm, inhibited, and submissive to other children and adults.
Individual differences in Extraversion first manifest in infancy as varying levels of positive emotionality.
These differences in turn predict social and physical activity during later childhood and may represent, or be associated with, the behavioral activation system.
*Activity: Children with high activity tend to have high energy levels and more intense and frequent motor activity compared to their peers.
Salient differences in activity reliably manifest in infancy, persist through adolescence, and fade as motor activity decreases in adulthood or potentially develops into talkativeness.
*Dominance: Children with high dominance tend to influence the behavior of others, particularly their peers, to obtain desirable rewards or outcomes.
Such children are generally skilled at organizing activities and games and deceiving others by controlling their nonverbal behavior.
*Shyness: Children with high shyness are generally socially withdrawn, nervous, and inhibited around strangers.
In time, such children may become fearful even around “known others”, especially if their peers reject them.
*Sociability: Children with high sociability generally prefer to be with others rather than alone.
During middle childhood, the distinction between low sociability and high shyness becomes more pronounced, particularly as children gain greater control over how and where they spend their time.
===Development of the Big Five throughout adulthood===Many studies of longitudinal data, which correlate people's test scores over time, and cross-sectional data, which compare personality levels across different age groups, show a high degree of stability in personality traits during adulthood.
It is shown that the personality stabilizes for working-age individuals within about four years after starting working.
There is also little evidence that adverse life events can have any significant impact on the personality of individuals.
More recent research and meta-analyses of previous studies, however, indicate that change occurs in all five traits at various points in the lifespan.
The new research shows evidence for a maturation effect.
On average, levels of agreeableness and conscientiousness typically increase with time, whereas extraversion, neuroticism, and openness tend to decrease.
Research has also demonstrated that changes in Big Five personality traits depend on the individual's current stage of development.
For example, levels of agreeableness and conscientiousness demonstrate a negative trend during childhood and early adolescence before trending upwards during late adolescence and into adulthood.
In addition to these group effects, there are individual differences: different people demonstrate unique patterns of change at all stages of life.
In addition, some research (Fleeson, 2001) suggests that the Big Five should not be conceived of as dichotomies (such as extraversion vs. introversion) but as continua.
Each individual has the capacity to move along each dimension as circumstances (social or temporal) change.
He is or she is therefore not simply on one end of each trait dichotomy but is a blend of both, exhibiting some characteristics more often than others:Research regarding personality with growing age has suggested that as individuals enter their elder years (79–86), those with lower IQ see a raise in extraversion, but a decline in conscientiousness and physical well being.
Research by Cobb-Clark and Schurer indicates that personality traits are generally stable among adult workers.
The research done on personality also mirrors previous results on locus of control.
===Brain structures===Some research has been done to look into the structures of the brain and their connections to personality traits of the FFM.
Two main studies were done by Sato et al.
(2012)and DeYoung et al.
Results of the two are as follows:* Neuroticism: negatively correlated with ratio of brain volume to remainder of intracranial volume, reduced volume in dorsomedial PFC and a segment of left medial temporal lobe including posterior hippocampus, increased volume in the mid-cingulate gyrus.
* Extraversion: positively correlated with orbitofrontal cortex metabolism, increased cerebral, volume of medial orbitofrontal cortex.
* Agreeableness: negatively correlated with left orbitofrontal lobe volume in frontotemporal dementia patients, reduced volume in posterior left superior temporal sulcus, increased volume in posterior cingulate cortex.
*Conscientiousness: volume of middle frontal gyrus in left lateral PFC.
* Openness to experience: No regions large enough to be significant, although parietal cortex may be involved.
==Group differences=====Gender differences===Cross-cultural research has shown some patterns of gender differences on responses to the NEO-PI-R and the Big Five Inventory.
For example, women consistently report higher Neuroticism, Agreeableness, warmth (an extraversion facet) and openness to feelings, and men often report higher assertiveness (a facet of extraversion) and openness to ideas as assessed by the NEO-PI-R.A study of gender differences in 55 nations using the Big Five Inventory found that women tended to be somewhat higher than men in neuroticism, extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness.
The difference in neuroticism was the most prominent and consistent, with significant differences found in 49 of the 55 nations surveyed.
Gender differences in personality traits are largest in prosperous, healthy, and more gender-egalitarian cultures.
A plausible explanation for this is that acts by women in individualistic, egalitarian countries are more likely to be attributed to their personality, rather than being attributed to ascribed gender roles within collectivist, traditional countries.
Differences in the magnitude of sex differences between more or less developed world regions were due to differences between men, not women, in these respective regions.
That is, men in highly developed world regions were less neurotic, extraverted, conscientious and agreeable compared to men in less developed world regions.
Women, on the other hand tended not to differ in personality traits across regions.
The authors of this study speculated that resource-poor environments (that is, countries with low levels of development) may inhibit the development of gender differences, whereas resource-rich environments facilitate them.
This may be because males require more resources than females in order to reach their full developmental potential.
The authors also argued that due to different evolutionary pressures, men may have evolved to be more risk taking and socially dominant, whereas women evolved to be more cautious and nurturing.
Ancient hunter-gatherer societies may have been more egalitarian than later agriculturally oriented societies.
Hence, the development of gender inequalities may have acted to constrain the development of gender differences in personality that originally evolved in hunter-gatherer societies.
As modern societies have become more egalitarian, again, it may be that innate sex differences are no longer constrained and hence manifest more fully than in less-developed cultures.
Currently, this hypothesis remains untested, as gender differences in modern societies have not been compared with those in hunter-gatherer societies.
===Birth-order differences===Frank Sulloway argues that firstborns are more conscientious, more socially dominant, less agreeable, and less open to new ideas compared to laterborns.
Large scale studies using random samples and self-report personality tests, however, have found milder effects than Sulloway claimed, or no significant effects of birth order on personality.
==Cultural differences==The Big Five have been replicated in a variety of languages and cultures, such as German, Chinese, Indian, etc.
For example, Thompson has demonstrated the Big Five structure across several cultures using an international English language scale.
Cheung, van de Vijver, and Leong (2011) suggest, however, that the Openness factor is particularly unsupported in Asian countries and that a different fifth factor is sometimes identified.
Recent work has found relationships between Geert Hofstede’s cultural factors, Individualism, Power Distance, Masculinity, and Uncertainty Avoidance, with the average Big Five scores in a country.
For instance, the degree to which a country values individualism correlates with its average extraversion, whereas people living in cultures which are accepting of large inequalities in their power structures tend to score somewhat higher on conscientiousness.
Although this is an active area of research, the reasons for these differences are as yet unknown.
Attempts to replicate the Big Five in other countries with local dictionaries have succeeded in some countries but not in others.
Apparently, for instance, Hungarians do not appear to have a single agreeableness factor.
Other researchers have found evidence for agreeableness but not for other factors.
==Relationships=====Personality disorders===As of 2002, there were over fifty published studies relating the FFM to personality disorders.
Since that time, quite a number of additional studies have expanded on this research base and provided further empirical support for understanding the DSM personality disorders in terms of the FFM domains.
In her seminal review of the personality disorder literature published in 2007, Dr. Lee Anna Clark asserted that "the five-factor model of personality is widely accepted as representing the higher-order structure of both normal and abnormal personality traits".
The five-factor model has been shown to significantly predict all ten personality disorder symptoms and outperform the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) in the prediction of borderline, avoidant, and dependent personality disorder symptoms.
Research results examining the relationships between the FFM and each of the ten DSM personality disorder diagnostic categories are widely available.
For example, in a study published in 2003 titled "The five-factor model and personality disorder empirical literature: A meta-analytic review", the authors analyzed data from 15 other studies to determine how personality disorders are different and similar, respectively, with regard to underlying personality traits.
In terms of how personality disorders differ, the results showed that each disorder displays a FFM profile that is meaningful and predictable given its unique diagnostic criteria.
With regard to their similarities, the findings revealed that the most prominent and consistent personality dimensions underlying a large number of the personality disorders are positive associations with neuroticism and negative associations with agreeableness.
===Common mental disorders===Neuroticism is a prospective risk factor for the common mental disorders, including anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders, and also shows substantial concurrent overlap.
===Education=======Academic achievement====Personality plays an important role that affects academic achievement.
A study conducted with 308 undergraduates who completed the Five Factor Inventory Processes and offered their GPA suggested that conscientiousness and agreeableness have a positive relationship with all types of learning styles (synthesis analysis, methodical study, fact retention, and elaborative processing), whereas neuroticism has an inverse relationship with them all.
Moreover, extraversion and openness were proportional to elaborative processing.
The Big Five personality traits accounted for 14% of the variance in GPA, suggesting that personality traits make great contributions to academic performance.
Furthermore, reflective learning styles (synthesis-analysis and elaborative processing) were able to mediate the relationship between openness and GPA.
These results indicate that intellectual curiousness has significant enhancement in academic performance if students can combine their scholarly interest with thoughtful information processing.
Studies conducted on college students have concluded that hope, which is linked to agreeableness, has a positive effect on psychological well being.
Individuals high in neurotic tendencies are less likely to display hopeful tendencies and are negatively associated with well-being.
Personality can sometimes be flexible and measuring the big five personality for individuals as they enter certain stages of life may predict their educational identity.
Recent studies have suggested the likelihood of an individual's personality affecting their educational identity.
====Learning styles====Learning styles have been described as "enduring ways of thinking and processing information."
Although there is no evidence that personality determines thinking styles, they may be intertwined in ways that link thinking styles to the Big Five personality traits.
There is no general consensus on the number or specifications of particular learning styles, but there have been many different proposals.
Smeck, Ribicj, and Ramanaih (1997) defined four types of learning styles:*synthesis analysis*methodical study*fact retention*elaborative processingWhen all four facets are implicated within the classroom, they will each likely improve academic achievement.
This model asserts that students develop either agentic/shallow processing or reflective/deep processing.
Deep processors are more often than not found to be more conscientious, intellectually open, and extraverted when compared to shallow processors.
Deep processing is associated with appropriate study methods (methodical study) and a stronger ability to analyze information (synthesis analysis), whereas shallow processors prefer structured fact retention learning styles and are better suited for elaborative processing.
The main functions of these four specific learning styles are as follow:Openness has been linked to learning styles that often lead to academic success and higher grades like synthesis analysis and methodical study.
Because conscientiousness and openness have been shown to predict all four learning styles, it suggests that individuals who possess characteristics like discipline, determination, and curiosity are more likely to engage in all of the above learning styles.
According to the research carried out by Komarraju, Karau, Schmeck & Avdic (2011), conscientiousness and agreeableness are positively related with all four learning styles, whereas neuroticism was negatively related with those four.
Furthermore, extraversion and openness were only positively related to elaborative processing, and openness itself correlated with higher academic achievement.
Besides openness, all Big Five personality traits helped predict the educational identity of students.
Based on these findings, scientists are beginning to see that there might be a large influence of the Big Five traits on academic motivation that then leads to predicting a student's academic performance.
Recent studies suggest that Big Five personality traits combined with learning styles can help predict some variations in the academic performance and the academic motivation of an individual which can then influence their academic achievements.
This may be seen because individual differences in personality represent stable approaches to information processing.
For instance, conscientiousness has consistently emerged as a stable predictor of success in exam performance, largely because conscientious students experiences fewer study delays.
The reason conscientiousness shows a positive association with the four learning styles is because students with high levels of conscientiousness develop focused learning strategies and appear to be more disciplined and achievement-oriented.
However, the American Psychological Society recently commissioned a report whose conclusion indicates that no significant evidence exists to make the conclusion that learning-style assessments should be included in the education system.
The APA also suggested in their report that all existing learning styles have not been exhausted and that there could exist learning styles that have the potential to be worthy of being included in educational practices.
===Work success===It is believed that the Big Five traits are predictors of future performance outcomes.
Job outcome measures include job and training proficiency and personnel data.
However, research demonstrating such prediction has been criticized, in part because of the apparently low correlation coefficients characterizing the relationship between personality and job performance.
In a 2007 article co-authored by six current or former editors of psychological journals, Dr. Kevin Murphy, Professor of Psychology at Pennsylvania State University and Editor of the Journal of Applied Psychology (1996-2002), states::The problem with personality tests is … that the validity of personality measures as predictors of job performance is often disappointingly low.
The argument for using personality tests to predict performance does not strike me as convincing in the first place.
Such criticisms were put forward by Walter Mischel, whose publication caused a two-decades' long crisis in personality psychometrics.
However, later work demonstrated (1) that the correlations obtained by psychometric personality researchers were actually very respectable by comparative standards, and (2) that the economic value of even incremental increases in prediction accuracy was exceptionally large, given the vast difference in performance by those who occupy complex job positions.
Those who express these traits have showed leadership and beneficial ideas towards the country of origin.
Some businesses, organizations, and interviewers assess individuals based on the Big Five personality traits.
Research has suggested that individuals who are considered leaders typically exhibit lower amounts of neurotic traits, maintain higher levels of openness (envisioning success), balanced levels of conscientiousness (well-organized), and balanced levels of extraversion (outgoing, but not excessive).
Further studies have linked professional burnout to neuroticism, and extraversion to enduring positive work experience.
When it comes to making money, research has suggested that those who are high in agreeableness (especially men) are not as successful in accumulating income.
==Non-humans==The Big Five personality traits have been assessed in some non-human species.
In one series of studies, human ratings of chimpanzees using the Chimpanzee Personality Questionnaire (CPQ) revealed factors of extraversion, conscientiousness and agreeableness – as well as an additional factor of dominance – across hundreds of chimpanzees in zoological parks, a large naturalistic sanctuary, and a research laboratory.
Neuroticism and openness factors were found in an original zoo sample, but were not replicated in a new zoo sample or in other settings (perhaps reflecting the design of the CPQ).
A study review found that markers for the three dimensions extraversion, neuroticism, and agreeableness were found most consistently across different species, followed byopenness; only chimpanzees showed markers for conscientious behavior.
==Measurements==Several measures of the Big Five exist:* International Personality Item Pool (IPIP)* NEO-PI-R* Big Five Inventory* Self-descriptive sentence questionnaires* Lexical questionnaires* Self-report questionnaires* Relative-scored Big 5 measureThe most frequently used measures of the Big Five comprise either items that are self-descriptive sentences or, in the case of lexical measures, items that are single adjectives.
Due to the length of sentence-based and some lexical measures, short forms have been developed and validated for use in applied research settings where questionnaire space and respondent time are limited, such as the 40-item balanced "International English Big-Five Mini-Markers" or a very brief (10 item) measure of the Big Five domains.
Research has suggested that some methodologies in administering personality tests are inadequate in length and provide insufficient detail to truly evaluate personality.
Usually, longer, more detailed questions will give a more accurate portrayal of personality.
The five factor structure has been replicated in peer reports.
However, many of the substantive findings rely on self-reports.
Much of the evidence on the measures of the Big 5 relies on self-report questionnaires, which makes self-report bias and falsification of responses difficult to deal with and account for.
It has been argued that the Big Five tests do not create an accurate personality profile because the responses given on these tests are not true in all cases.
For example, questionnaires are answered by potential employees who might choose answers that paint them in the best light.
This becomes especially important when considering why scores may differ between individuals or groups of people– differences in scores may represent genuine underlying personality differences, or they may simply be an artifact of the way the subjects answered the questions.
Research suggests that a relative-scored Big Five measure in which respondents had to make repeated choices between equally desirable personality descriptors may be a potential alternative to traditional Big Five measures in accurately assessing personality traits, especially when lying or biased responding is present.
When compared with a traditional Big Five measure for its ability to predict GPA and creative achievement under both normal and “fake good”-bias response conditions, the relative-scored measure significantly and consistently predicted these outcomes under both conditions; however, the Likert questionnaire lost its predictive ability in the faking condition.
Thus, the relative-scored measure proved to be less affected by biased responding than the Likert measure of the Big Five.
Andrew H. Schwartz analyzed 700 million words, phrases, and topic instances collected from the Facebook messages of 75,000 volunteers, who also took standard personality tests, and found striking variations in language with personality, gender, and age.
Schwartz's research is a departure from many of the efforts that other researchers have made in that it uses data that was not taken specifically in order to determine personality.
==Criticisms==Much research has been conducted on the Big Five.
This has resulted in criticism and support for the model.
Critics argue that there are limitations to the scope of Big Five as an explanatory or predictive theory.
It is argued that the Big Five does not explain all of human personality.
The methodology used to identify the dimensional structure of personality traits, factor analysis, is often challenged for not having a universally-recognized basis for choosing among solutions with different numbers of factors.
Another frequent criticism is that the Big Five is not theory-driven, it is merely a data-driven investigation of certain descriptors that tend to cluster together under factor analysis.
===Limited scope===One common criticism is that the Big Five does not explain all of human personality.
Some psychologists have dissented from the model precisely because they feel it neglects other domains of personality, such as religiosity, manipulativeness/machiavellianism, honesty, sexiness/seductiveness, thriftiness, conservativeness, masculinity/femininity, snobbishness/egotism, sense of humour, and risk-taking/thrill-seeking.
Dan P. McAdams has called the Big Five a "psychology of the stranger", because they refer to traits that are relatively easy to observe in a stranger; other aspects of personality that are more privately held or more context-dependent are excluded from the Big Five.
In many studies, the five factors are not fully orthogonal to one another; that is, the five factors are not independent.
Orthogonality is viewed as desirable by some researchers because it minimizes redundancy between the dimensions.
This is particularly important when the goal of a study is to provide a comprehensive description of personality with as few variables as possible.
===Methodological issues===Factor analysis, the statistical method used to identify the dimensional structure of observed variables, lacks a universally recognized basis for choosing among solutions with different numbers of factors.
A five factor solution depends on some degree of interpretation by the analyst.
A larger number of factors may, in fact, underlie these five factors.
Big Five proponents have responded that although other solutions may be viable in a single dataset, only the five factor structure consistently replicates across different studies.
===Theoretical status===A frequent criticism is that the Big Five is not based on any underlying theory; it is merely an empirical finding that certain descriptors cluster together under factor analysis.
Although this does not mean that these five factors do not exist, the underlying causes behind them are unknown.
Jack Block’s final published work before his death in January 2010 drew together his lifetime perspective on the five-factor model.
He summarized his critique of the model in terms of:* the atheoretical nature of the five-factors.
* the model’s inappropriateness for studying early childhood.
* the use of factor analysis as the exclusive paradigm for conceptualizing personality.
* the continuing non-consensual understandings of the five-factors.
* the existence of unrecognized but successful efforts to specify aspects of character not subsumed by the five-factors.
He went on to suggest that repeatedly observed higher order factors hierarchically above the proclaimed Big Five personality traits may promise deeper biological understanding of the origins and implications of these superfactors.

Wherever possible, there must be independent validation of the concepts whose truth should be proved.
He states that reason and logic would succeed once the truth is known.
Conclusions emerge from premises, and the acceptability of the premises should not be discounted or accepted because of bias.
===Baloney detection kit===Sagan presents a set of tools for skeptical thinking which he calls the "baloney detection kit" (page 210f).
Skeptical thinking consists both of constructing a reasoned argument and recognizing a fallacious or fraudulent one.
In order to identify a fallacious argument, Sagan suggests the employment of such tools as independent confirmation of facts, debate, development of different hypotheses, quantification, the use of Occam's razor, and the possibility of falsification.
Through these tools, Sagan argues the benefits of a critical mind and the self-correcting nature of science can take place.
Sagan provides a skeptical analysis of several examples of what he refers to as superstition, fraud, and pseudoscience such as witches, UFOs, ESP, and faith healing.
He is critical of organized religion.
===Misuse of science===Sagan indicates that science can be misused.
Thus, he is highly critical of Edward Teller, the "father of the hydrogen bomb", and his influence on politics and contrasts his stance to that of Linus Pauling and other scientists who took moral positions.

Software Center was partially prepared for touch control by including larger icons.
Software Center also brought Unity Launcher integration, sorting by ratings and system requirements for applications.
Some GDebi technology was also integrated to improve speed when handling .deb files.
The web store shows the same content as the Software Center application, with a download button that opens the application if running Ubuntu or a link to download Ubuntu itself if running a different operating system.
Canonical created a web based developer platform to help programmers to create applications for Ubuntu.
Software Center included a new category: "Books and magazines", ability to show video presentations of paid applications and multiple screenshots per one app.

One adverse effect of "Clonorchis" is the possibility for the adult metacercaria to consume all bile created in the liver, which would inhibit the host human from digesting, especially fats.
Another possibility is obstruction of the bile duct by the parasite or its eggs, leading to biliary obstruction and cholangitis (specifically oriental cholangitis).
"Central Serous Retinopathy" (CSR) a report of 80 cases by Dr. John Chiao-nan Chang, M.D.
and Dr. Yin-Ping Wang, M.D.
Hong Kong on page 125 of their report observed that 19% of the cases of CSR in their sample tested positive for "Clonorchis sinensis".
=== Symptoms ===While normally asymptomatic most pathological manifestations result from inflammation and intermittent obstruction of the biliary ducts.
The acute phase consists of abdominal pain with associated nausea and diarrhea.
Long-standing infections consist of fatigue, abdominal discomfort, anorexia, weight loss, diarrhea, and jaundice.
The pathology of long-standing infections consist of bile stasis, obstruction, bacterial infections, inflammation, periductal fibrosis, and hyperplasia.
Development of cholangiocarcinoma is progressive.
=== Diagnosis and treatment ===Infection is detected mainly on identification of eggs by microscopic demonstration in faeces or in duodenal aspirate.
But other sophisticated methods have been developed such as ELISA, which has become the most important clinical technique.
Diagnosis by detecting DNAs from eggs in faeces are also developed using PCR, real-time PCR, and LAMP, which are highly sensitive and specific.
Imaging diagnosis has been studied in depth and is now widely used.
As with other trematodes, praziquantel is the drug of choice.
Lately, tribendimidine has been acknowledged as an effective and safe drug.

Asteroid 18883 Domegge was discovered by Gina Fedon and Mark Abraham from their EverStaR Observatory.
The name was chosen by Gina, who grew up in Domegge di Cadore, a village in the Italian Eastern Alps, the Dolomites.
She remembered the nights she spent looking up at the stars outside her childhood home, and as her interest in astronomy started there, she thought the name would be appropriate.

Any climber bound for the South Col on Everest must climb this wall of glacial blue ice.
This face rises at 40 and 50 degree pitches with the occasional 80 degree bulges.
High-altitude climbing Sherpas and the lead climbers will set fixed ropes up this wall of ice.
Climbers and porters need to establish a good rhythm of foot placement and pulling themselves up the ropes using their jumars.
Two rocky sections called the Yellow Band and the Geneva Spur interrupt the icy ascent on the upper part of the face.

For instance:* Java, Pascal, Ada and C require all variables to have a declared type, and support the use of explicit casts of arithmetic values to other arithmetic types.
Java, C#, Ada and Pascal are sometimes said to be more strongly typed than C, a claim that is probably based on the fact that C supports more kinds of implicit conversions, and C also allows pointer values to be explicitly cast while Java and Pascal do not.
Java itself may be considered more strongly typed than Pascal as manners of evading the static type system in Java are controlled by the Java Virtual Machine's type system.
C# is similar to Java in that respect, though it allows disabling dynamic type checking by explicitly putting code segments in an "unsafe context".
* The object-oriented programming languages Smalltalk, Perl, JavaScript, Ruby, Python, and Self are all "strongly typed" in the sense that typing errors are prevented at runtime and they do little implicit type conversion, but these languages make no use of static type checking: the compiler does not check or enforce type constraint rules.
The term duck typing is now used to describe the dynamic typing paradigm used by the languages in this group.
* The Lisp family of languages are all "strongly typed" in the sense that typing errors are prevented at runtime.
Some Lisp dialects like Common Lisp or Clojure do support various forms of type declarations and some compilers (CMUCL and related) use these declarations together with type inference to enable various optimizations and also limited forms of compile time type checks.
These languages (along with most functional languages) are considered to have stronger type systems than Java, as they permit no implicit type conversions.
In addition to variables with declared types, it is also possible to declare a variable of "Variant" data type that can store data of any type.
Its implicit casts are fairly liberal where, for example, one can sum string variants and pass the result into an integer variable.
There is no type checking; it is up to the programmer to ensure that data given to functions is of the appropriate type.
Any type conversion required is explicit.

His father, Alexander Ivanovich Alekhine, was a landowner and Privy Councilor to the conservative legislative Fourth Duma.
Later in 1942 he won at Warsaw/Lublin/Kraków (the 3rd GG-ch; October 1942) and tied for first with Klaus Junge in Prague ("Duras Jubileé"; December 1942).
Spraggett makes a case for the manipulation of the crime scene and the autopsy by the Portuguese secret police PIDE.
A later computer-assisted analysis concludes that White can force a win, but only by diverging from Alekhine's move sequence at move 20, while there are only three queens.
Main Line (D64) 1–0 Alekhine conjures up an attack in the endgame, and his King joins the fray.
*Efim Bogolyubov vs Alexander Alekhine, Hastings 1922, Dutch Defence, Classical Variation (A91), 0–1 This has been called one of the greatest games ever played, with some incredibly deep variations as Black prepares to queen a pawn.
*Ernst Gruenfeld vs Alexander Alekhine, Karlsbad 1923, Queen's Gambit Declined: Orthodox Defense.
Rubinstein Attack (D64), 0–1 Gruenfeld makes no obvious mistakes but his slow build-up lets Alekhine take the initiative and start squeezing him off the board.
Gruenfeld desperately tries to free his position and is crushed by a series of sacrifices that forces the win of a piece or checkmate.
*Richard Reti vs Alexander Alekhine, Baden Baden 1925, Hungarian Opening: Reversed Alekhine (A00), 0–1 A tactically complex game in which Alekhine unleashes a 12-move combination that wins a Knight.
*Jose Raul Capablanca vs Alexander Alekhine, World Championship match, Buenos Aires 1927, Queen's Gambit Declined (D52), 0–1 The game ends in a position with four queens on the board.
*Alexander Alekhine vs Aron Nimzowitsch, San Remo 1930, French Defence, Winawer Variation (C17), 1–0 One of the shortest games ending in a zugzwang – by the 26th move, Black is already strategically lost and has no good moves.
*Gideon Stahlberg vs Alexander Alekhine, Hamburg 1930, 3rd Olympiad, Nimzo-Indian Defence, Spielmann Variation (E23), 0–1 1st best game prize.
*Max Euwe vs Alexander Alekhine, World Championship Match, game 4, The Hague 1935, Grunfeld Defence, Russian Variation (D81), 0–1 Alekhine sacrifices two rooks, but traps Euwe's King in the centre, wins the queen, then finishes elegantly.

== Citation ==The name is "Standing Stones" in Gaelic, a term used to refer to the stones placed during neolithic times into small or large groups, often into circles, throughout the British Isles.
Many of these arrangements exhibit astronomical alignments, and are thought to have been used in at least some cases to track the progression of seasons and mark the occurrence of other significant astronomical events.
The name was suggested by Alice Cathryne Dennis, seventh-grade student at The Mountain School in Flagstaff, Arizona, as winner of a contest to name this asteroid in conjunction with the 1997 Flagstaff Festival of Science.

Under his leadership, observation of Near-Earth asteroid 4179 Toutatis were successfully carried out in December 1992 using the 70-m dish of the Evpatoria Planetary Radar (EPR) in Ukraine, as the sounding signal transmitter and the 100-m radio telescope in Effelsberg in Germany, as the two-channel receiver of the radar echo from the minor planet's surface.
Zaitsev is also responsible for initiating the world's first intercontinental radar astronomy experiment, 70-m dish of the Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex to 70-m dish of the EPR observations of 6489 Golevka in June 1995.

He haswritten numerous articles on these subjects, including some on Canadianmeteorites, in the Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada, andhe has been of much practical help to the astrometric program carried out atthe University of Victoria.
Spratt maintains a carefully chosenrepresentative collection of meteorites and was coordinator for thenorthwest North American section of the Amateur Observation Network of theInternational Halley Watch.
He has contributed more than 32 000observations of long-period and semiregular variable stars and dwarf novaeto the American Association of Variable Star Observers and in 1976 was themost prolific observer of that year.
The Chant Medal of the RoyalAstronomical Society of Canada was bestowed upon him in 1988.
Spratt holdsan honors diploma in horticulture and, as a professional member of thegardening staff at the University of Victoria, does much to make theuniversity a pleasant place in which to work.

Its name is a combination of the names of astronomers J. Palisa and M. Wolf, in recognition of their cooperation.
The asteroid's provisional name was 1930 AD.
Reinmuth had discovered so many minor planets that he had trouble thinking of proper names for the numbered ones, and so he selected girl's names from the calendar "Der Lahrer hinkende Bote".
These names do not have any connections with his contemporaries.
==Binary system==Photometric and Arecibo echo spectra observations in 2005 confirmed a satellite orbiting at least from the primary.
Due to the similar size of the primary and secondary the Minor Planet Center lists this as a binary companion.
It orbits once every 6 years.
==Binary system==Photometric observations in 2007 revealed a ~3 km satellite (diameter ratio of 0.23) with an orbital period of 17.57 hours.
Due to the similar size of the primary and secondary the Minor Planet Center lists this as a binary companion.

==Habitat==This Old World monkey travels quadrupedally, usually on the ground,as it is not very agile in trees.
It is generally found in subtropical and tropical broadleaf evergreen forests, in different elevations depending on the amount of rainfall in the area.
It depends on rainforests for food and shelter, and is not found in dry forests except where it ranges in the Himalayan region of India, only spending time in secondary forests if it is bordering primary tropical forests.
A study population was introduced to Tanaxpillo, an uninhabited island in Lake Catemaco, Veracruz, Mexico in 1974, where it ranges in seminatural conditions.
Most information on the species comes from the introduced population on Tanaxpillo and other captive settings, as few long-term studies have been conducted on the stump-tailed macaque in the wild.

After harvest, the seaweed is dried, baled, and sent to the carrageenan manufacturer.
There the seaweed is ground, sifted to remove impurities such as sand, and washed thoroughly.
After treatment with hot alkali solution (e.g., 5–8% potassium hydroxide), the cellulose is removed from the carrageenan by centrifugation and filtration.
The resulting carrageenan solution is then concentrated by evaporation.
It is dried and ground to specification.
The raw weed is first sorted and crude contaminants are removed by hand.
The weed is then washed to remove salt and sand, and then cooked in hot alkali to increase the gel strength.
The cooked weed is washed, dried, and milled.
"E. spinosum" undergoes a much milder cooking cycle, as it dissolves quite readily.
The product is called semi-refined carrageenan, Philippines natural grade or, in the U.S., it simply falls under the common carrageenan specification.
===Refined===The essential difference in the refining process is that the carrageenan is first dissolved and filtered to remove cell wall debris.
The carrageenan is then precipitated from the clear solution either by isopropanol or by potassium chloride.
===Mixed processing===A hybrid technology in which seaweed is treated heterogeneously as in the semirefined process exists, but alcohol or high salt levels are used to inhibit dissolution.
This process is often used on South American seaweeds and gives some of the cost benefits of semirefined processing, while allowing a wider range of seaweeds to be processed, however, the naturally low cellulose levels in some South American seaweeds allow them to be heterogeneously processed and still be sold under the EU refined specification.
== Uses =====Food and other domestic uses===* Desserts, ice cream, cream, milkshakes, salad dressings, sweetened condensed milks, and sauces: gel to increase viscosity* Beer: clarifier to remove haze-causing proteins* Pâtés and processed meats (ham, e.g.
===Research===Carrageenan is inert to hydrolysis by intestinal enzymes in both humans and monogastric animals.
Many older studies and a few recent studies have been based on the use of "degraded carrageenan", a fraction of low-molecular weight segments of the carrageenan molecular backbone called "poligeenan".
Approximately 8% of the fragments of food-grade carrageenan are of molecular mass less than 50,000 Da, in excess of the recommended minimum of 5% set by the European Scientific Committee on Food to ensure that the presence of poligeenan is kept to a minimum.
The proportion of this 8% that consists of poligeenan is unknown.
Refined carrageenan has a 2% maximum for acid insoluble material and is produced through an alcohol precipitation process or potassium chloride gel press process.
Indonesia, the Philippines, and Chile are three main sources of raw material and extracted carrageenan.

On 23 August 2011, the Polish Presidency of the European Union organised a conference on the occasion of the European Day of Remembrance for the Victims of Totalitarian Regimes.
European officials adopted the Warsaw Declaration for the European Day of Remembrance for the Victims of Totalitarian Regimes.
The Warsaw Declaration vows that the suffering of victims of totalitarian regimes "will not sink into oblivion."
The declaration states that "crimes of totalitarian regimes in Europe should be acknowledged and condemned, regardless of their type and ideology."
Justice Minister Krzysztof Kwiatkowski said that the "Warsaw Declaration is a unanimous agreement of all EU member states that we have to do everything we can to prevent any totalitarian regime from reviving in all the countries making up one big European family."
EU Justice Commissioner Viviane Reding stated on this occasion::"Totalitarian regimes are the denial of human dignity and the violation of all fundamental rights of our societies built upon democracy and the respect of the rule of law.
We must offer the victims of those crimes, and their family members, sympathy, understanding and recognition of their suffering.
Every victim of any totalitarian regime has the same human dignity and deserves justice, remembrance and recognition by all of us."
On 23 August 2014, EU justice commissioner Martine Reicherts emphasized that the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact "of Nazi Germany under Hitler and the Soviet Union under Stalin would pave the way for the most brutal war to this day, leading to many years of fear, horror and pain for the victims of these regimes," stating that the Europe-wide Day of Remembrance for the victims of all totalitarian and authoritarian regimes is a reminder that we must not take "dignity, freedom, democracy, the rule of law and human rights" for granted, and that "peace, democracy and fundamental rights are not a given.

Thus every man who utters a doubt defines a religion."
("Heretics", 12th Edition, 1919)* G. K. Chesterton: "But to have avoided heresies has been one whirling adventure; and in my vision the heavenly chariot flies thundering through the ages, the dull heresies sprawling and prostrate, the wild truth reeling but erect."
It is not.
It is so.
Those who are ideologues are not intelligent."
("Tao Te Ching", Verse 81, 6th century BCE)* James G. March on the relations among madness, heresy, and genius: "... we sometimes find that such heresies have been the foundation for bold and necessary change, but heresy is usually just new ideas that are foolish or dangerous and appropriately rejected or ignored.
So while it may be true that great geniuses are usually heretics, heretics are rarely great geniuses."

Considers the political consequences of the remarks in a 1751 pamphlet by Franklin on demographic growth and its implications for the colonies.
He called the Pennsylvania Germans "Palatine Boors" who could never acquire the "Complexion" of the English settlers and to "Blacks and Tawneys" as weakening the social structure of the colonies.
Although Franklin apparently reconsidered shortly thereafter, and the phrases were omitted from all later printings of the pamphlet, his views may have played a role in his political defeat in 1764.

Puppy 4 is built from scratch using the T2 SDE and no longer features native Slackware 12 compatibility in order to reduce the size and include newer package versions than that found in 3.
To compensate for this, an optional "compatibility collection" of packages was created that restores some of the lost compatibility.
*Puppy 4.2 features changes to the user interface and backend, upgraded packages, language and character support, new in-house software and optimizations, while still keeping the ISO image size under 100 MB.
Puppy 5 is based on a project called Woof which is designed to assemble a Puppy Linux distribution from the packages of other Linux distributions.
Woof includes some binaries and software derived from Ubuntu, Debian, Slackware, T2 SDE, or Arch repositories.
Puppy 5 came with a stripped down version of the Midori browser to be used for reading help files and a choice of web browsers to be installed, including Chromium, Firefox, SeaMonkey Internet Suite, Iron and Opera.
==Reception==DistroWatch reviewer Rober Storey concluded about Puppy 5.2.5 in April 2011: "A lot of people like Puppy - it's in the top 10 of the DistroWatch page-hit ranking.
I enjoy Puppy too, and it's what I run exclusively on my netbook.
I've never heard of a single Puppy user suffering a problem due to this."
Fosdick concluded "I like Puppy because it's the lightest Linux distro I've found that is still suitable for end users.
Install it on an old P-III or P-IV computer and your family or friends will use it just as effectively for common tasks as any expensive new machine."
In December 2011 Jesse Smith, writing in DistroWatch reviewed Puppy 5.3.0 "Slacko Puppy".
He praised its simplicity, flexibility and clear explanations, while noting the limitations of running as root.
He concluded "I would also like to see an option added during the boot process which would give the user the choice of running in unprivileged mode as opposed to running as root.
Always being the administrator has its advantages for convenience, but it means that the user is always one careless click away from deleting their files and one exploit away from a compromised operating system.
As a live CD it's hard to beat Puppy Linux for both performance and functional software.
It has minimal hardware requirements and is very flexible.
It's a great distro as long as you don't push it too far out of its niche."
In December 2011 Howard Fosdick reviewed the versions of Puppy Linux then available.
He concluded, "Puppy's diversity and flexibility make it a great community-driven system for computer enthusiasts, hobbyists, and tinkerers.
They also make for a somewhat disorderly world.
You might have to read a bit to figure out which Puppy release or Puplet is for you.
Puppy's online documentation is extensive but can be confusing.
It's not always clear which docs pertain to which releases.
Most users rely on the active, friendly forum for support."
He also noted "Those of us who enjoy computers sometimes forget that many view them with disdain.
What's wrong with it now?
Why on earth do they change the interface in every release?
Can't it just work?
Puppy is a great solution for these folks.
It's up-to-date, free, and easy to use.
And now, it supports free applications from the Ubuntu, Slackware, or Puppy repositories.

Linear operators are ubiquitous in the theory of quantum mechanics.
For example, observable physical quantities are represented by self-adjoint operators, such as energy or momentum, whereas transformative processes are represented by unitary linear operators such as rotation or the progression of time.

The episode was written by Marc Cherry and was directed by Larry Shaw.
It originally aired on Sunday October 10, 2004.
== Plot ==Mary Alice thought that she knew everyone, but had she looked further, she would have realized that she was never looking deep beneath the surface.
Had she realized this, she would have known that Gabrielle Solis was a "drowning woman" and she would have offered to help her.
Mary Alice only saw the side of Gabrielle that most of the others saw: her expensive jewelry, her fabulous designer clothing, and her diamond watch.
Gabrielle knew that she was lonely since her husband Carlos was constantly away but knew that if she lost him or they separated she would be less happy than she already was.
This is perhaps the reason that John Rowland is not only Gabrielle's personal gardener but also her current lover.
As the two relax in the bathtub, Gabrielle hears a noise from outside.
When she looks out the window, she finds Carlos getting out of his car and checking the mail.
Gabrielle panics and quickly devises a plan to get John out of there.
The two race down the stairs and Gabrielle throws John out a window.
John falls into the shrubs and quickly puts his shirt on.
Simultaneously, Carlos enters the house oblivious of what is going on.
Carlos asks why Gabrielle took a bath in the afternoon which she explains by saying that she had just worked out.
When Carlos asks where John is, Gabrielle quivers until John pleasantly greets the two from the window while trimming the shrubs.
The women gather the following evening at Susan's to discuss the mysterious note that was used to blackmail Mary Alice.
Susan thinks that they should share the letter with Paul since it could be used as evidence to find the writer.
Gabrielle thinks that he would break down.
Bree agrees but Lynette scoffs at the suggestion since it would only make matters worse.
The four leave without a resolution and decide to talk about it in the morning.
Meanwhile, Bree tries to save her marriage with Rex by going to couple counseling with Dr. Albert Goldfine, supposedly Fairview's number 1 therapist.
Dr. Goldfine has handled cases such as domestic abuse, affairs, and marital disputes but has never met anyone as eccentric as the Van De Kamps.
At their first few sessions, Rex manages to get his complaints about the marriage out in the open but when it's time for Bree to talk she rambles on with small talk.
Dr. Goldfine tells her to think about herself and Rex sometimes other than always obsessing about the housework or the children.
As Dr. Goldfine gives Bree these suggestions, Bree focuses on a button that is torn on his suit.
Later, Bree returns privately to Dr. Goldfine where she offers to re-sew his button.
As she does him this favor, the two talk about how Rex always exaggerates and that the marriage is not entirely her fault.
Dr. Goldfine agrees but he believes that the blame be put on both parties.
At their next session, Rex talks once again and Dr. Goldfine manages to remind him that he should be thankful that Bree does all the nice things that she does because it is not mandated of her to do so.
Rex feels shut down as Bree smiles back at Goldfine.
Susan decides to make her move on Mike by inviting him to one of her "annual" welcome dinners for the new neighbors.
Mike accepts her offer.
However knowing that her cooking is bad, Mike agrees to cook and hold it at his house.
He also invites Julie to come as well.
As they talk, they are interrupted by Edie who asks what is going on.
Mike tells Edie that Susan has just invited him over for one of her traditional welcome dinners.
Edie asks why she did not get one and Susan replies that it is a new tradition.
Edie decides it will be fun and wants to join in.
Susan definitely decides to bring Julie since she will save her from doing something awkward in front of Mike and Edie.
Susan tries to get at Mike's early to help him but Edie has arrived unexpectedly before her.
The dinner goes well and the only person Susan has failed to impress is Mike's dog, Bongo, who has taken more of an interest in Edie.
Susan decides to butter up the dog by putting drops of gravy on her face.
Susan successfully manages to get Bongo to like her but he accidentally swallows her earring and begins to choke.
Mike rushes out of the house with the dog to drive it to the hospital.
At the animal hospital Susan apologizes to Mike.
He also offers his apology since the dog was originally his deceased wife's.
Susan realizes that Mike still has feeling for his dead wife and that he will not be available for a while.
Susan quietly hugs him as they get the news that Bongo is all right.
With Tom away once again, Lynette has trouble with her children in the car.
After being insulted by a police officer on her parenting, she lashes back at him by telling him how stressful it is to be a stay-at-home mom.
When the officer sees how stressed out Lynette is, he gives her a warning and walks back to his car.
Later, Mrs. Huber tells Lynette how her mother got her to behave in the car.
She quickly came back however and Martha never misbehaved again.
Lynette agrees to try the method out with unsuccessful results.
When the children act up once again, Lynette pulls up to a street and lets the kids out.
Lynette then drives around the block and comes back.
When she arrives back, the boys are missing and Lynette panics.
Lynette asks a woman if she has seen the boys but she has seen everything and asks what kind of mother abandons her children.
Lynette says that she has not abandoned them and that she was coming right back.
Edie moves in with Mrs. Huber shortly after the fire at her house.
At the crime scene, Mrs. Huber finds a piece of evidence: Susan's measuring cup.
While collecting clothes for Edie, Martha visits Julie where she learns that they have purchased a new measuring cup.
After being almost caught by Carlos, Gabrielle decides that she and John cannot have sex in the house anymore.
When Gabrielle shows up unexpectedly at John's house, he offers her a token of his affection by giving her a beautiful rose.
Gabrielle treasures the gift and John says that he wants to make sure that their relationship lasts for a long time.
When John sees that Carlos has purchased Gabrielle a new car, he learns that Gabrielle is still in love with Carlos and that he will have to share her.
During the middle of the night, Paul Young throws a child's toy chest in the town lake.
The contents inside are unknown at this time, raising more suspicions to the Mary Alice mystery.

Scott Wallace, grandson of Henry A. Wallace, interviewed by Paul Jay (video).
Beinart argued that Truman's 1948 defeat of Wallace helped transform the Democrats into an anti-totalitarian party.
Beinart condemned liberal Democrats who opposed the 2003 Iraq invasion as "Wallacite", a derogatory term he coined to indicate "soft on totalitarianism and external threats".
Beinart subsequently reversed his position on the Iraq war, saying it had been "a tragic mistake".

==History==Common Vetch has also been part of the human diet, as attested by carbonised remains found at early Neolithic sites in Syria, Turkey, Bulgaria, Hungary and Slovakia.
It has also been reported from predynastic sites of ancient Egypt, and several Bronze Age sites in Turkmenia and Slovakia.
However, definite evidence for later vetch cultivation is available only for Roman times.

Because the Kailua incident was a violation of her Los Angeles probation, she was sentenced to 60 days in jail, a 30-day alcohol rehabilitation program and another 30 days of community service, including work for Mothers Against Drunk Driving, by a Los Angeles judge on May 1, 2006.
Because of overcrowding, she was released from jail on the same day she entered.
She wrote about the experience on her blog.
In September 2007, Rodriguez allegedly violated her probation by not completing her community service and not following an alcohol education program.
It was reported that she originally submitted a document stating she performed community service on September 5, 2006, but it was later confirmed she was actually in New York City that day.
Her lawyer claimed it was a clerical error.
On October 10, 2007, following a hearing, she was sentenced to 180 days jail time after agreeing to admit to violating her probation.
She was expected to spend the full 180-day term in jail, as she had been deemed ineligible for work furloughs and house arrest.

Named in honor of Orville B. Karge (1919–1990), instructor of physics at San Dieguito High School and Torrey Pines High School, near San Diego, California.
Karge was known to be selflessly devoted to teaching and the development of opportunities for students to independently explore their interests beyond the classroom.
His encouragement to enter science fairs, sponsorship of a long-lived rocketry and astronomy club, and an open-lab policy provided educational challenges and adventures for his physics students and many others.

It has been estimated that between a third and a half of the published material on the MBTI has been produced for conferences of the Center for the Application of Psychological Type (which provides training in the MBTI) or as papers in the "Journal of Psychological Type" (which is edited by Myers–Briggs advocates).
It has been argued that this reflects a lack of critical scrutiny.
Many of the studies that endorse MBTI are methodologically weak.
A 1996 review by Gardner and Martinko concluded: "It is clear that efforts to detect simplistic linkages between type preferences and managerial effectiveness have been disappointing.
Indeed, given the mixed quality of research and the inconsistent findings, no definitive conclusion regarding these relationships can be drawn."
For example, some researchers expected that scores would show a bimodal distribution with peaks near the ends of the scales, but found that scores on the individual subscales were actually distributed in a centrally peaked manner similar to a normal distribution.
A cut-off exists at the center of the subscale such that a score on one side is classified as one type, and a score on the other side as the opposite type.
This fails to support the concept of "type": the norm is for people to lie near the middle of the subscale.
"Although we do not conclude that the absence of bimodality necessarily proves that the MBTI developers’ theory-based assumption of categorical “types” of personality is invalid, the absence of empirical bimodality in IRT-based MBTI scores does indeed remove a potentially powerful line of evidence that was previously available to “type” advocates to cite in defense of their position."
In 1991, the National Academy of Sciences committee reviewed data from MBTI research studies and concluded that only the I-E scale has high correlations with comparable scales of other instruments and low correlations with instruments designed to assess different concepts, showing strong validity.
In contrast, the S-N and T-F scales show relatively weak validity.
The 1991 review committee concluded at the time there was "not sufficient, well-designed research to justify the use of the MBTI in career counseling programs".
This study based its measurement of validity on "criterion-related validity (i.e., does the MBTI predict specific outcomes related to interpersonal relations or career success/job performance?)."
Studies have found that there is insufficient evidence to make claims about utility, particularly of the four letter type given after the test.
The accuracy of the MBTI depends on honest self-reporting by the person tested.
Unlike some personality measures, such as the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory or the Personality Assessment Inventory, the MBTI does not use validity scales to assess exaggerated or socially desirable responses.
As a result, individuals motivated to do so can fake their responses, and one study found that the MBTI judgment/perception dimension correlates weakly with the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire lie scale.
However, the MBTI ethical guidelines state, "It is unethical and in many cases illegal to require job applicants to take the Indicator if the results will be used to screen out applicants."
The intent of the MBTI is to provide "a framework for understanding individual differences, and … a dynamic model of individual development".
One study reports that the MBTI dichotomies exhibit good split-half reliability; however, the dichotomy scores are distributed in a bell curve, and the overall "type" allocations are less reliable.
Also, test-retest reliability is sensitive to the time between tests.
Within each "dichotomy" scale, as measured on Form G, about 83% of categorizations remain the same when individuals are retested within nine months, and around 75% when individuals are retested after nine months.
About 50% of people tested within nine months remain the same overall "type", and 36% remain the same type after more than nine months.
For Form M (the most current form of the MBTI instrument), the MBTI "Manual" reports that these scores are higher (p. 163, Table 8.6).
In one study, when people were asked to compare their preferred type to that assigned by the MBTI assessment, only half of people picked the same profile.
Critics also argue that the MBTI lacks falsifiability, which can cause confirmation bias in the interpretation of results.
A number of scholars argue that criticisms regarding the MBTI mostly come down to questions regarding the validity of its origins, not questions regarding the validity of the MBTI's usefulness.
Others argue that the MBTI can be a reliable measurement of personality; it just so happens that "like all measures, the MBTI yields scores that are dependent on sample characteristics and testing conditions".

"Edge" rated the game 8/10 saying "It's off-putting to new players, too busy tying up loose ends to dangle any threads of its own, and fails to stand up as its own game in the same manner as its predecessors.
But it's also a spectacular, powerfully imagined and dramatically involving final act to one of gaming's richest sci-fi sagas."

Within the genus "Mustela", the least weasel is a relatively unspecialised form, as evidenced by its pedomorphic skull, which occurs even in large subspecies.
Its direct ancestor was "Mustela praenivalis", which lived in Europe during the Middle Pleistocene and Villafranchian.
The modern species probably arose during the Late Pleistocene.
The least weasel is the product of a process begun 5–7 million years ago, when northern forests were replaced by open grassland, thus prompting an explosive evolution of small, burrowing rodents.
The weasel's ancestors were larger than the current form, and underwent a reduction in size to exploit the new food source.
The least weasel throve during the Ice Age, as its small size and long body allowed it to easily operate beneath snow, as well as hunt in burrows.
It probably crossed to North America through the Bering land bridge 200,000 years ago.
Least weasels of the "vulgaris" group, for example, may outweigh the smaller races by almost four times.
In some large subspecies, the male may be 1.5 times longer than the female.
Variations in tail length are also variable, constituting from 13–30% of the length of the body.
The winter fur is dense, but short and closely fitting.
In northern subspecies, the fur is soft and silky, but coarse in southern forms.
The summer fur is very short, sparser and rougher.
The upper parts in the summer fur are dark, but vary geographically from dark-tawny or dark-chocolate to light pale tawny or sandy.
The lower parts, including the lower jaw and inner sides of the legs, are white.
In the northern hemisphere, the average litter size consists of 6 kits and these reach sexual maturity in 3 to 4 months.
Males may mate during their first year of life, though this is usually unsuccessful.
They are fecund in February–October, though the early stages of spermatogenesis do occur throughout the winter months.
Newborn kits are born pink, naked, blind and deaf, but gain a white coat of downy fur at the age of 4 days.
At 10 days, the margin between the dark upper parts and light under parts becomes visible.
===Territorial and social behaviours===The least weasel has a typical mustelid territorial pattern, consisting of exclusive male ranges encompassing multiple female ranges.
The population density of each territory depends greatly on food supply and reproductive success, thus the social structure and population density of any given territory is unstable and flexible.
Like the stoat, the male least weasel extends its range during spring or during food shortages.
Its scent marking behaviour is similar to that of the stoat; it uses faeces, urine and anal and dermal gland secretions, the latter two of which are deposited by anal dragging and body rubbing.
The least weasel has four basic vocalisations; a guttural hiss emitted when alarmed, which is interspersed with short screaming barks and shrieks when provoked.
When defensive, it emits a shrill wail or squeal.
During encounters between males and females or between a mother and kits, the least weasel emits a high-pitched trilling.
Dominant weasels exhibit lunges and shrieks during aggressive encounters, while subdominant weasels will emit submissive squeals.
===Diet===The least weasel feeds predominantly on mouse-like rodents, including mice, hamsters, gerbils and others.
It usually does not attack adult hamsters and rats.
Frogs, fish, small birds and bird eggs are rarely eaten.
It can deal with adult pikas and gerbils, but usually cannot overcome brown rats and sousliks.
Exceptional cases are known of least weasels killing prey far larger than themselves, such as capercaillie, hazel hen and hares.
Male least weasels take a higher proportion of rabbits than females, as well as an overall greater variety of prey.
This is linked to the fact that being larger, and having vaster territorial ranges than females, males have more opportunities to hunt a greater diversity of prey.
It is adapted for pursuing its prey down tunnels, though it may also bolt prey from a burrow and kill it in the open.
The least weasel kills small prey, such as voles, with a bite to the occipital region of the skull or the neck, dislocating the cervical vertebrae.
Large prey typically dies of blood loss or circulatory shock.
When food is abundant, only a small portion of the prey is eaten, usually the brain.
===Predators and competitors===The least weasel is small enough to be preyed upon by a range of other predators.
Least weasel remains have been found in the excrement of red foxes, sables, steppe and forest polecat, stoats, eagle owls and buzzards.
The owls most efficient at capturing least weasels are barn, barred, and great horned owls.
Other birds of prey threatening to the least weasel include broad-winged and rough-legged buzzards.
Some snake species may prey on the least weasel, including the black rat snake and copperhead.
Aside from its smaller size, the least weasel is more vulnerable to predation than the stoat because it lacks a black predator deflection mark on the tail.
In areas where the least weasel is sympatric with the stoat, the two species compete with each other for rodent prey.
It actively avoids encounters with stoats, though female weasels are less likely to stop foraging in the presence of stoats, perhaps because their smaller size allows them to quickly escape into holes.
The species may catch fleas from the nests and burrows of its prey.
Similarly, a popular superstition in southern Greece had it that the least weasel had previously been a bride, who was transformed into a bitter animal which would destroy the wedding dresses of other brides out of jealousy.
According to Pliny the Elder, the least weasel is the only animal capable of killing the basilisk;To this dreadful monster the effluvium of the weasel is fatal, a thing that has been tried with success, for kings have often desired to see its body when killed; so true is it that it has pleased Nature that there should be nothing without its antidote.
The animal is thrown into the hole of the basilisk, which is easily known from the soil around it being infected.
The weasel destroys the basilisk by its odour, but dies itself in this struggle of nature against its own self.
The Chippewa believed that the least weasel could kill the dreaded wendigo giant by rushing up its anus.
In Inuit mythology, the least weasel is credited with both great wisdom and courage, and whenever a mythical Inuit hero wished to accomplish a valorous task, he would generally change himself into a least weasel.
According to Matthew Hopkins, a witch hunter general during the English Civil War, least weasels were the familiars of witches.

==Early life==Tariq al-Hashimi was born in 1942 in Baghdad, Iraq, in the Mashhadan tribe.
He earned a bachelor's degree in economics from Al-Mustansiriya University in 1969, and a master's degree in 1978.
At the age of 33, he left the Iraqi Army, and became active in the Iraqi Islamic Party (IIP), serving on its planning committee.
Hashimi opposes federalism, wants oil revenues distributed based on population, de-Baathification reversed and more Sunnis in the new military and police.
"USA Today" reported in December 2006 that Hashimi was involved in forming a multi-sectarian alliance to replace the government of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, with the encouragement of U.S. President George W. Bush, to counter the political influence of Muqtada al-Sadr.
At a meeting with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan in 2007, Hashimi said that the Iraqi government was prepared to cooperate with Turkey in the Turkish fight against Kurdish Workers Party.
The compact calls for serious dialogue between the factions in Iraq.
Hashimi stepped down as secretary general of the IIP in May 2009, and Osama al Tikriti was elected to fill the position.
The Iraqi government banned him from travelling abroad.
In addition, on 19 December 2011, Iraq's Judicial Council issued an arrest warrant for Hashimi, accusing him of orchestrating bombing attacks.
The arrest warrant was based on the testimony of his bodyguards, and came just one day after the final U.S. troop withdrawal of remaining forces from Iraq.
One day later, Hashimi denied all charges against him in a press conference in the Kurdish regional capital Arbil, since he had been there before the arrest warrant was issued.
The dispute between the Sunni Muslim Hashimi and the primarily Shia administration of Prime Minister Maliki generated concern over the stability of the young Iraqi government amid the ongoing sectarian conflict.
President of Kurdistan Massoud Barzani declared in March 2012 that the Kurdistan Regional Government would not hand over Hashimi to Iraqi authorities because Kurdish ethics prevented them from doing so.
Hashimi denied all charges and claimed constitutional immunity from the prosecution.
On 1 April 2012, Hashimi was allowed by the authorities in Kurdistan to travel to Qatar to meet with Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, on what the Qatari administration described as an official diplomatic visit.
Iraqi deputy prime minister Hussain al-Shahristani denounced the visit as unacceptable on Qatar's part and called for Hashimi to be immediately handed over.
However, Qatar refused the request of the Iraq government to extradite Hashimi, stating that extradition would be against diplomatic norms.
Later, Hashimi went to Saudi Arabia and met with Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud Al Faisal.
==Trial==In February 2012, a panel of Iraqi judges accused him of leading paramilitary teams to coordinate more than 150 attacks in the past six years mostly against his political opponents, Iraqi security officials and religious pilgrims.
Based on these accusations, the trial for Hashimi and his son-in-law, Ahmed Qahtan (who was also his secretary), began in May 2012.
The charges against them included the murders of a female lawyer and a Shia brigadier-general.
In addition, the trial also covered 150 charges against Hashimi and his bodyguards due to their alleged involvement in attacks which occurred after the invasion of Iraq.
In the court, Hashimi's bodyguards declared that they had been ordered and paid by him to perform the attacks.
Abdul Sattar al-Berqdar, a spokesman for Iraq's Supreme Judicial Council, said that Hashimi was sentenced to hang "because he was involved directly in killing a female lawyer and a general with the Iraqi army".
A third charge against Hashimi was dismissed for lack of evidence.
The death sentences are not final and can be appealed within 30 days.
A wave of attacks erupted the same day, killing more than 100 people.

Young further praised the visual style of the film with "Kim gives scenes a dark, hand-held look in which the frame edge disappears into black shadows.
It’s not a particularly attractive style but does reflect the ugliness of its subject."
Felperin further states the film is a "blend of cruelty, wit and moral complexity."
And the disturbing, vaguely Oedipal relationship at the core is a fascinating one..." However Lyttelton gave the film a C+, and criticizes "It's a shame then, that in the second half of the film, the interestingly twisted mother-son relationship shifts gears and becomes something closer to the kind of revenge movie that Korean cinema has become known for.

In India, they have been found to be fed by black drongos and ashy drongo.
Other hosts that have been recorded include black-headed oriole, streaked spiderhunter, "Eurylaimus ochromalus" and "Dicrurus paradiseus".
The eggs of the cuckoo hatch in 12 days while those of the brown shrike in the Amur region take 14 days.
During the third or fourth day, the young bird bends its back when touched and heaves out other eggs or nestlings.
This instinct is lost soon after.

*"Phalaenopsis hieroglyphica" (the Philippines - Luzon, Leyte, Samar, Palawan, and Mindanao islands).
Over about three months the spike elongates until it begins to swell fat buds which will bloom.
Using two "Phalaenopsis" clones, Matthew G. Blanchard and Erik S. Runkle (2006) established that, other culture conditions being optimal, flower initiation is controlled by daytime temperatures declining below , with a definite inhibition of flowering at temperatures exceeding .
The long-held belief that reduced evening temperatures control flower initiation in "Phalaenopsis" is shown to be false.
Rather, lower daytime temperatures influence flowering, while night time temperatures do not appear to have any effect.

Orconectes shoupi, the Nashville crayfish, is a species of crayfish in the family Cambaridae.
Horton Hobbs, Jr., discovered this rare crayfish in the 1940s along with C. S. Shoup, a Vanderbilt University professor and colleague.
The Nashville crayfish is considered an endangered species by the IUCN Red List, due to the threat of urban development, specifically at the mouth of the creek all the way to the headwaters.
The unusual amounts of de-icer used at Nashville International Airport after the increased snowfall in the winter of 2009–2010, may have caused deaths of "Orconectes shoupi".
Although it is being slowly out-competed by the rusty crayfish, "Orconectes rusticus", it is listed as a species of Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.

==Distribution=="Parapinnixa affinis" appears to be endemic to Southern California, having been recorded from San Pedro, Anaheim Landing, Newport Bay and San Diego.
It was once recorded from Siberia, but this record is doubtful.
A bryozoan from the family Vesiculariidae is sometimes found on the legs of "P. affinis".
==Taxonomy=="Parapinnixa affinis" was first described by Samuel Jackson Holmes in 1900, in his "Synopsis of California stalk-eyed Crustacea".
The type specimen was a single female, collected in July 1895 from Dead Man's Island, San Pedro, California (now part of the Port of Los Angeles); it was donated to the University of California.
No further specimens were collected for over thirty years, until one was collected in 1930, and Steve Glassell collected specimens including an allotype in 1932.

Vulbens is located 20 kilometres southwest of Geneva, on the hills of the Vuache.
Vulbens has a border with Switzerland, the commune of Chancy.
Other neighbouring municipalities are Chevrier, Pougny, Valleiry, Viry and Dingy-en-Vuache.
==History==Vulbens was part of the former province Genevois of the Duchy of Savoy.
Templars moved in 1196 to Vulbens, near the place called "Port of the Isles" (near Collogny) and controlled the passage of the Rhone by people crossing by ferry Traille.
The area of the Knights Templar later became the property of the hospital and then was transformed into a farm to the Revolution.
Today, riding stables, the only visible remnant of his past is a portal which is engraved on the cross of Malta on the keystone.
During the French Revolution, the Savoy region was conquered by France and Vulbens became attached to the "département" of Léman, of which capital was Geneva.
After the Bourbon Restoration in 1815, it was returned to the Kingdom of Sardinia (heir of the Duchy of Savoy).

==History==The town and name of Champdieu evolved in the course of ages.
First of all CANDICUS (Roman leader), then in the 11th century the village is called CANDIACO.
It becomes in the 13th century CHANDIACO then CHANDIEU and becoming in the 16th century into "FIELD-GOD" expression in French to finally in 1801 to be registered CHAMPDIEU.
CASTRUM CANDIACO"Sunt autem ipsæ res site in pago Lugdunense, in agro Candiacense, in villa et Castrum Candiaco dei Baronum Candiæ"Latin inscription in the land registry of the Castle and baronny of Candia.
The origin of the village parried be previous to Carolingian times.
==Geography==Cran-Gevrier is in the east of Annecy.
The hamlet of Cran was on the level of the Thiou river.
The Fier forms most of the commune's north-western border.
==History==The city draws its origins from two hamlets: Cran and Gevrier.
* Gevrier, the oldest hamlet, got its name either from the Grabriaccus villa, or from the word "guivre", the name of a mythical snake whose role in tales is to keep treasures (one finds a snake rolled up around a sword on the blazon of the lords of Aléry).
The Romans were the first to settle on the hill.
A Roman villa and a theatre were built there.
It is located very close to Geneva, Switzerland.
The name of Collonges (from the Latin "colonica") designates a colony of farmers situated on land granted, along with certain liberties, by the land owner.
The town dates from the fourth or fifth century.
The modern commune has its roots in the Ancien Régime, arising out of a parish whose existence is recorded from the twelfth century.
Although the town, and Haute Savoie generally, is traditionally Catholic, Collonges-sous-Salève is the location of Adventist University of France – Collonges and Maurice-Tièche comprehensive school, both owned by the Seventh-day Adventist church.
==History==Balbigny owes its name to a Roman general named Balbinius who based himself here in order to conduct a war.
Nothing survives from this period.
The earliest identified traces of Balbigny date from 1090.
During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, before the Loire was channelled, Balbigny was a village of boatmen, known for flat bottomed boats known as "Rambertes" which were used to transport the coal mined at Saint-Étienne.
The loaded Rambertes arrived from Saint-Rambert and stopped off at Balbigny where the boat crews were changed, taking the boats to the next change-over point at Roanne.
All this changed in August 1832 with the arrival of the third oldest railway line in France which connected Andrézieux-Bouthéon with Roanne, passing Balbigny en route.
An extension of the rail network in 1913 saw Balbigny connected with Saint-Germain-Laval and Régny.
The coal was therefore transported by rail, but the railway also gave farmers in the district access to a wider range of markets for their produce.
The road bridge crossing the Loire was destroyed in 1940 in order to hold back advancing German troops, and a ferry service was introduced to permit the river to be crossed.
Rucentra melancholica is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae.
==Water==Saint Galmier is a spa town and the source of Badoit mineral water.
The thermal spring was known of in Gallo-Roman times, but its fame increased with the general growth in interest in thermal cures in Europe during the nineteenth century.
Before Auguste Badoit appeared on the scene and commercialised the water in the 1830s, both the water, and the spring from which it emerged, were known as "Fontfort".
It is for this reason that briefly, during the French Revolutionary period, the town was known as "Fontfortville".

Abondance is a commune in the Haute-Savoie department in the Rhône-Alpes region in south-eastern France.
The commune was founded around the year 1040.
Abondance was the first ski resort in the Alps to shut down due to lack of snow, due to alleged global warming.
In the 2006–2007 ski season, the town lost money due to lifts being shut down.
The town's plea for government aid to support the resort was denied due to its unlikeliness to return to profit due to lack of snow.
Abondance is home to the international boarding school Sainte Croix des Neiges.

Situated in the northern French Alps, the commune sits on a large sunny plateau overlooking the Arve Valley southeast of the town of Cluses.
It is part of the canton of Cluses.
The main villages in the commune are Arâches, Les Carroz, and La Frasse.
It is now developing into the nearest large ski resort to Geneva.
By 1981 Les Carroz had been linked to the nearby ski villages of Samoëns, Morillon and Sixt-Fer-à-Cheval, and the resort of Flaine, developed in the 1960s.
The Grand-Massif ski area had been born.

In 2001, Biju questioned the validity of this species due to lack of type specimens in the museum.
In 2007, some of the same authors suggested the alternative name of "Nyctibatrachus karnatakaensis", stating that "Nyctibatrachus hussaini" was invalid due to the lack of a traceable holotype, though two of the authors claiming this were responsible for the original description.
This became the subject of considerable controversy, as problems were noted in peer-review practices and adherence to the ICZN code.

Psorothamnus schottii is a species of flowering plant in the legume family known by the common name Schott's dalea.
Its highly branching stems are green to woolly gray-green and glandular.
The gland-pitted linear leaves are up to 3 centimeters long and not divided into leaflets.
The inflorescence is an open raceme of up to 15 flowers.
Each flower has a deep purple blue pealike corolla up to a centimeter long in a glandular tubular calyx of sepals with pointed lobes.
The fruit is a legume pod coated in glands and containing one seed.
Psorothamnus arborescens is a species of flowering plant in the legume family known by the common name Mojave indigo bush.
The leaves are each made up of a few pairs of green linear to oval leaflets up to a centimeter in length.
The inflorescence is a long raceme of many flowers with reddish green calyces of sepals and bright purple pealike corollas up to a centimeter long.
The fruit is a glandular legume pod up to a centimeter long containing one seed.
Dalea pulchra (Santa Catalina prairie clover, Indigo Bush) is a perennial shrub or subshrub of the subfamily Faboideae in the Pea Family-(Fabaceae).
It is found in the southwestern United States and Northwestern Mexico in the states of Arizona, New Mexico, Sonora, and Chihuahua, in the Madrean sky islands region and associated areas.
Santa Catalina Prairie Clover can be found in some common resource locations, for example: Ironwood Forest National Monument of southern Arizona.
As a shrub it can grow to tall.
The Santa Catalina Prairie Clover has the same name as the sky island mountain range of southeast Arizona, the Santa Catalinas.
Due to the proximity to these watercourses, River Red Gum is subject to regular flooding in its natural habitat.
River Red Gum prefers soils with clay content.
The association of the River Red Gum with water makes the tree a natural habitat choice, indeed sometimes the only choice in drier areas, for other species.
The trees provide a breeding habitat for fish during the flooding season, which also benefits aquatic bird life that depend on fish as a food source during their own breeding season.
Wilson, who examined the management of River Red Gums in NSW, suggests shelter is provided for fish in rivers and streams by fallen branches from the River Red Gum.
The "snags" formed when River Red Gums fall into rivers such as the Glenelg, are an important part of river ecosystems, and vital habitat and breeding sites for native fish like River Blackfish.
Unfortunately most snags have been removed from these rivers, beginning in the 1850s, due to river-improvement strategies designed to prevent hazards to navigation, reduce damage to in-stream structures, rejuvenate or scour channels, and increase hydraulic capacity to reduce flooding.
However, the Murray–Darling Basin Commission has recognised the importance of snags as aquatic habitat, and a moratorium on their removal from the Murray River has been recommended.
Hollows start to form at around 120–180 years of age, creating habitat for many wildlife species, including a range of breeding and roosting animals such as bats, carpet pythons, and birds.
The dense foliage of the tree also provides shade and shelter from the sun in drier areas.
The Superb Parrot, a threatened species, is amongst the bird species that nest in the River Red Gum.
This is especially important to the ecology in areas of low nutrients.
The anther sacs open into longitudinal slits to release their pollen.
These filaments will extend to encircle the receptacle during flowering.
The female parts of the flower, the ovaries, are contained in ovary chambers.
These chambers are separated from the receptacle containing the male parts by a disc.
From the top of the ovaries a structure called the style extends into the receptacle, to form the stigma.
During flowering, pollen from the anthers can fall onto the stigma.
This can occasionally lead to self-pollination, although the stigma does not become receptive until a few days after the operculum has been detached by the expanding stamens, and the flower's pollen has already been released.
Fertilisation will therefore occur with other flowers on the same tree or other flowers on a different tree.
Insects, birds, and small mammals help in the pollination of other flowers.
After flowering, the stamens will detach.
The fruit is the part of the flower that remains after fertilisation, which enlarges, dries, and becomes woody.
Triangular valves in the fruit will open, dispersing yellow, cuboid seeds.
Dissemination occurs mostly in spring and summer, while natural flooding occurs during winter and spring.
As the tree is inextricably linked with waterways, seed dispersion would logically be facilitated by floodwater.
There is some contention in this theory, however, where the CSIRO describes an experiment that demonstrated seeds were found to sink after only 36 hours.
It would also seem that as the seeding and flooding do not entirely coincide, it could be inferred that the conditions for germination, such as damp soil and plenty of sunlight, are more important in the continuation of the species than seed dispersal by means of floodwater.
Seeding during the flooding season would prevent desiccation of the seed, which is the main cause of a seed's failure to reproduce.
Despite this apparent evolutionary advantage of the species living near watercourses to avoid seed desiccation, many seeds will be produced within a Camaldulensis forest before one will grow to its own reproducing stage.
A gap in the forest must be available for the germinated seed to receive adequate sunlight.
== Formation of the Barmah Red Gum Forests ==The formation of the famous Barmah Red Gum Forests is due to a relatively recent geological event in the Murray-Darling Basin involving the Cadell fault.
River Red Gum seeds germinate readily after floods and require regular spring floods throughout their life to survive.
In the Murray-Darling Basin, such floods are now rare due to river regulation for irrigation, and as a result, 75% of River Red Gums in the lower Murray are stressed, dead or dying.
It retains enormous cultural significance to the Indigenous traditional owners, the Yorta Yorta Nation.
Like many stands of River Red Gum, the Barmah-Millewa has been drastically altered by over 100 years of timber harvesting.
There is a paucity of old hollow-bearing trees which provide habitat for rare and threatened fauna such as the Superb Parrot, Brush-tailed Phascogale and Inland Carpet Python.
The increasing scale of logging machinery is creating large areas of intensive soil disturbance and bare earth, which is likely to increase weed invasion and increase the likelihood of the extinction of rare understorey plants.
About 25,000 years ago, displacement occurred along the Cadell fault, raising the eastern edge of the fault (which runs north-south) above the floodplain.
This created a complex series of events.
A section of the original Murray River channel immediately behind the fault was abandoned, and exists today as an empty channel known as Green Gully.
The Goulburn River was dammed by the southern end of the fault to create a natural lake.
The Murray River flowed to the north around the Cadell Fault, creating the channel of the Edward River which exists today and through which much of the Murray River's waters still flow.
Then the natural dam on the Goulburn River failed, the lake drained, and the Murray River avulsed to the south and started to flow through the smaller Goulburn River channel, creating "The Barmah Choke" and "The Narrows" (where the river channel is unusually narrow), before entering into the proper Murray River channel again.
The primary result of the Cadell Fault however is that the west-flowing water of the Murray River strikes the north-south running fault and diverts both north and south around the fault in the two main channels (Edwards and ancestral Goulburn) as well as a fan of small streams, and regularly floods a large amount of low-lying country in the area.
These conditions are perfect for River Red Gums, which rapidly formed forests in the area.
Thus the displacement of the Cadell Fault 25,000 years BP led directly to the formation of the Barmah River Red Gum Forests.
It quickly toughens up and can withstand drought even whilst in forestry tubes.
It makes an excellent bonsai and will readily regrow both from the base and from epicormic buds.
== Uses ==Red gum is so named for its brilliant red wood, which can range from a light pink through to almost black, depending on the age and weathering.
It is somewhat brittle and is often cross-grained, making hand working difficult.
Traditionally used in rot resistant applications like stumps, fence posts and sleepers, more recently it has been recognised in craft furniture for its spectacular deep red colour and typical fiddleback figure.
It needs careful selection, as it tends to be quite reactive to changes in humidity (moves about a lot in service).
It is a popular timber for wood turners, particularly if old and well-seasoned.
It is also popular for use as firewood.
Significant amounts of Victoria and NSW's firewood comes from Red Gums in the Barmah forest.
The wood makes fine charcoal, and is successfully used in Brazil for iron and steel production.
In addition, this plant is used for beekeeping in Brazil and Australia.
Plantations occur in Argentina, Arizona, Brazil, Burkina Faso, California, Egypt, Kenya, Morocco, Nigeria, Pakistan, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Tanzania, Uruguay, and Zimbabwe.
The areas of significance to humans of Eucalyptus camaldulensis include agricultural, ecological, cultural, and recreational significance.
The speed of growth of the tree makes it a useful plantation timber.
Apiarists also use the tree’s flowers for honey production.
E. camaldulensis is important in supporting the ecology of its habitat through providing food, and shelter for breeding.
Culturally, the species is an iconic part of Australia.
Its leaves have appeared on Australian stamps and is widely recognised due to its widespread range.
The use of the waterways for recreation also occurs within the habitat of the River Red Gum, again due their fundamental link to watercourses and floodplains.
Recreation would vary with the season.
===Population management===The predilection of the River Red Gum for waterways has been a successful evolutionary niche.
This has resulted in a large population and range for the species, and so it is not considered endangered.
Changes in its habitat, however, could be detrimental not just for the tree, but also for species that depend on the tree for their own survival.
These changes include grazing, and water regulation for irrigation purposes.
For example, grazing has an impact on the ability of the species to regenerate, as stock eat or trample the seedlings.
However, grazing may aid regeneration by removing thick ground cover.
In regards to water regulation, there are two problems.
One is the timing of the water flow, and the other is the minimisation of natural flooding.
Regulation causes flooding to be decreased during the winter and spring months, and water more consistently flows during the summer and autumn months.
Since the River Red Gum disperses its seed during spring, regulating the water may affect the species' ability to disperse using water as a dispersing agent, especially in floodplain Red Gum forests.
Natural water run-off can also be affected, leaving some trees permanently flooded due to the build-up of water behind dams, or the permanent water flow.
Neither can seeds germinate in constantly flooded areas.
Infrequent flooding due to water regulation provides inadequate water to recharge the floodplain subsoils that River Red Gums depend on.
This will result in stunted tree growth, death of existing trees, and poor conditions for seed germination.
Lack of flooding in floodplain areas will change the suitability of River Red Gum habitat as a breeding ground and food source for other species.
Indeed, extinctions of some species have already occurred in River Red Gum habitats in the Murray-Darling catchment.
It has been recognised since around the early 1980s that managing water more effectively would ensure the maintenance of River Red Gum habitat.
Water management would include the removal of subsidies for irrigation, issuing water licenses, and the flooding of forests in suitable seasons.

Serpulorbis is a genus of sea snails known as worm shells or worm snails.
"Serpulorbis" snails have shells which are long and irregular.
They do not have regular coiling like that of a typical gastropod shell, and they are usually cemented onto a hard surface.
Because of all this, the shells resemble the calcareous tubes of certain marine worms, for example worms in the polychaete family Serpulidae.

The color of the shell is somewhat white with spiral bands with a reddish-brown to bluish-black color on the leading edge of each varix.
The shell has a rather short, subacute, conical spire.
There are five convex whorls.
The body whorl is broad and spindle-shaped.
Each spire whorl contains six rounded varices that are broader at the body whorl, but thinner and curved back at the stubby,top whorls and around the siphonal canal.
The sutures between the whorls are deep and crossed by the oblique varices.
The porcelaneous white aperture has an oval shape and has a finely dentate outer lip.
The siphonal canal is rather short, almost completely closed and curved to the left at the base.
There is no apparent anal canal.
The inner surface of the aperture has a rippled form, reflecting the form of the ribs at the outer surface.
The columella is smooth.

Ropica variegata is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae.
The siphonal canal is rather short, curved to the left, fused at the top and almost sealed below.
They have six to seven well-developed varices per whorl, with deep hollows at the sutures.
These varices extend from the shoulder margin to the tip of the siphonal canal and become twisted at the base of the shell.
The deflection of the varices at the top of the shoulder of each whorl gives rise to a small pointed spine pointing to the preceding varix.

:2 Can you put a cord through his nose or pierce his jaw with a hook?
:3 Will he keep begging you for mercy?
Will he speak to you with gentle words?
:4 Will he make an agreement with you for you to take him as your slave for life?
:5 Can you make a pet of him like a bird or put him on a leash for your girls?
:6 Will traders barter for him?
Will they divide him up among the merchants?
:7 Can you fill his hide with harpoons or his head with fishing spears?
:8 If you lay a hand on him, you will remember the struggle and never do it again!
:9 Any hope of subduing him is false; the mere sight of him is overpowering.
:10 No-one is fierce enough to rouse him.
Who then is able to stand against me?
:11 Who has a claim against me that I must pay?
Everything under heaven belongs to me.
:12 I will not fail to speak of his limbs, his strength and his graceful form.
:13 Who can strip off his outer coat?
Who would approach him with a bridle?
:14 Who dares open the doors of his mouth, ringed about with his fearsome teeth?
:15 His back has rows of shields tightly sealed together;:16 Each is so close to the next that no air can pass between.
:17 They are joined fast to one another; they cling together and cannot be parted.
:18 His snorting throws out flashes of light; his eyes are like the rays of dawn.
:19 Firebrands stream from his mouth; sparks of fire shoot out.
:20 Smoke pours from his nostrils as from a boiling pot over a fire of reeds.
:21 His breath sets coals ablaze, and flames dart from his mouth.
:22 Strength resides in his neck; dismay goes before him.
:23 The folds of his flesh are tightly joined; they are firm and immovable.
:24 His chest is hard as rock, hard as a lower millstone.
:25 When he rises up, the mighty are terrified; they retreat before his thrashing.
:26 The sword that reaches him has no effect, nor does the spear or the dart or the javelin.
:27 Iron he treats like straw and bronze like rotten wood.
:28 Arrows do not make him flee, sling stones are like chaff to him.
:29 A club seems to him but a piece of straw, he laughs at the rattling of the lance.
:30 His undersides are jagged potsherds, leaving a trail in the mud like a threshing-sledge.
:31 He makes the depths churn like a boiling cauldron and stirs up the sea like a pot of ointment.
:32 Behind him he leaves a glistening wake; one would think the deep had white hair.
:34 He looks down on all that are haughty; he is king over all that are proud.

The Cognate Land Snail, Amphidromus cognatus is a large camaenid land snail endemic to Australia.
The ground colour of its shell is yellow, often with a peripheral spiral brown band, a purplish apical suffusion and a light yellow or white lip.
The snail was first described in 1907, from three specimens found at Port Essington on the Cobourg Peninsula before 1850, although it was not found there since.
Several sightings were made between 1976 and 1980, at one site on Bathurst Island and three sites at Melville Island.
The species is not listed on the Australian government's list of threatened fauna, but the Northern Territory government considers it Vulnerable.

Ropica vinacea is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae.
This genus was described by Verrill in 1882.
The interior of the shell is glossy and is a strong tan to dark brown color, similar to the common colors of the mineral onyx.
The shell of this species can be distinguished from the shell of "Crepidula adunca" by:* Its larger size,* The apex is low and near the margin of the shell, curved to one side and not markedly hooked (rather than high, hooked and centrally placed),* The interior shelf is notched at the ends, rather than curved forward at both ends, and* The periostracum is more prominent.
===Nonindigenous distribution===The species has been introduced and is considered to be established in Puget Sound, Washington, since 2005.

The upper part of the stem is a slender, spikelike inflorescence of widely spaced translucent green flowers.
The flowers are fragrant in the evenings, with a musky, soapy, or honeylike scent.
The plant is variable in size, stem thickness, density of inflorescence, petal shape, and scent.
Plants of the coast ranges and the Pacific Northwest are stouter and have broader sepals and petals than do interior and montane forms.

Capybaras can be found in many areas in zoos and parks, and may live for 12 years in captivity.
Capybaras are gentle and will usually allow humans to pet and hand-feed them.
The European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA) tasked Drusillas Park in Alfriston, Sussex to keep the studbook for Capybaras, to monitor captive populations in Europe.
The studbook includes information about all births, deaths and movements of capybaras, as well as how they are related.
Capybaras are farmed for meat and skins in South America.
The meat is considered unsuitable to eat in some areas, while in other areas it is considered an important source of protein.
In parts of South America, especially in Venezuela, capybara meat is popular during Lent and Holy Week as the Catholic Church previously gave a special dispensation that allows for its consumption while other meats are generally forbidden.
Although it is illegal in some states, capybaras are occasionally kept as pets in the United States.

Rhynchostylis retusa (also called Foxtail Orchid) is an exotic blooming orchid, belonging to the Vanda alliance.
The orchid has a bunch consisting of more than 100 pink-spotted white flowers.
They have stout, repent, short stem carrying up to 12, curved, fleshy, deeply channeled, keeled, retuse apically leaves and blooms on an axillary pendant to long, racemose, densely flowered, cylindrical inflorescence that occurs in the winter and early spring.
It is endemic to Christmas Island, an Australian territory in the north-eastern Indian Ocean.
Its specific epithet honours the Greek philosopher Archytas.
It has 4 or 5 lorate leaves, 100–220 mm long and 16–26 mm wide, unequally bilobed, forming a fan.
In 1882, João Barbosa Rodrigues published a description of a very different plant under the name of "Epidendrum geniculatum".
Eight years later, in 1890, Joseph Dalton Hooker published a description of an orchid now recognized as "Aerides multiflora" Roxb.
is a very different taxon from "Epidendrum geniculatum" Hook.f., a synonym for "Aerides multiflora" Roxb., the subject of this article.

Prosthechea cochleata, formerly known as Encyclia cochleata, Anacheilium cochleatum, and Epidendrum cochleatum and commonly referred to as the Cockleshell Orchid or Clamshell Orchid, is an epiphytic, sympodial New World orchid native to Central America, the West Indies, Colombia, Venezuela, and southern Florida.
Each oblong discoid pseudobulb bears one or two linear nonsucculent leaves.
The flowers are unusual in that though the labellum is usually below the column in the orchids, in the members of "Prosthechea" the labellum forms a "hood" over the column.
This makes the flower effectively upside down, or non-resupinate.
Whereas the species usually has one anther, "Prosthechea cochleata var.
triandra" is an endangered variety that has three anthers and is autogamous, allowing its existence in Florida where no appropriate pollinators appear to be present.
"P. cochleata" is common in cultivation, and is valued for its uniquely shaped and long-lasting flowers on continually growing racemes.
Several hybrids have been produced with this species, including the popular "Prosthechea" Green Hornet.

Corallorhiza striata is a species of orchid known by the common names striped coralroot and hooded coralroot.
== Description ==Like other coralroot orchids, it has reduced leaves and no chlorophyll and relies upon its parasitism of the fungi for sustenance.
This coralroot has an erect stem which may be red, pink, purple, or yellow-green to almost white.
It is mostly made up of an inflorescence of orchid flowers.
Each flower is an open array of sepals and similar-looking petals which may be pink or yellowish and have darker pink or maroon stripes.
Inside the flower is a column formed from the fusion of male and female parts, which may be spotted with purple or red.
The fruit is a capsule one or two centimeters long.

They are morphologically similar to "Phalaenopsis" and were a long time considered as species of that genus.
Their flowers are similar, but the leaves of Paraphalaenopsis are cylindrical and long (from 35 cm up to 3m in cultivation) and resemble the leaves of the Holcoglossum.
These are epiphytes that bloom in early spring.
Phalaenopsis pallens is an endemic species of orchid from the Philippines.

Epidendrum excisum is a species of orchid known to grow both epiphytically and terrestrially on steep rocky banks in mountainous regions of Columbia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela.
It has been reported at altitudes from 2.4 km to 2.8 km.
== Description ==The flattened stems grow to 0.9 m tall and are covered by the basal sheathes of the broad, oblong, leathery leaves.
The long base of the paniculate inflorescence erupts from two short, broad spathes at the apex of the stem.
The yellow flowers have filiform to linear petals, and obovate sepals, the lateral sepals being scoop-shaped.
The lateral lobes of the trilobate lip have a crenulate to erose margin, and give the lip (where it diverges from the column) a heart-shape.
The central lobe is divided into three short rounded lobes at its end: the central one narrow and bent downward, the lateral ones slightly longer, pointing outward and bent upward.
According to Kew, this variety is a synonym for the species.

Because of this dependence on myco-heterotrophy within their mycorrhizae, they cannot be successfully cultivated.
Most species do not produce chlorophyll, and do not depend on photosynthesis for energy.
An exception is the yellowish green species "Corallorhiza trifida", which has some chlorophyll and is only partially dependent on its fungal associates for nutrition.
This rare epiphytic species has only been found on two occasions in the cool, damp montane forests of the Western Cordillera of Colombia at altitudes between 1,800 m to 2,000 m.This tiny orchid lacks pseudobulbs.
The erect, thick, leathery leaf is elliptic-ovate in shape.
The aerial roots seem like fine hairs.
The flowers develop one at a time at the base of the leaf.
They are borne on a slender peduncle, originating from the base of the back of the leaf.
The long dorsal sepal is erect and ends in a somewhat thicker club-shaped tip.
They have fused lateral sepals (synsepals), which splits at its end.
They are quite colorful : tan overlaid with contrasting reddish-purple spots.
The long, lateral petals equally end in a thickened club-shaped tip.
The shorter lip is ovoid.
It shows the same variations in color and markings.
1844 is a species of "Epidendrum" orchid native to the western slopes of the Andes in Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru, and has been reported at altitudes ranging from 1.8 km, near Ocaña, Ayacucho, Peru, to 2.8 km, in Cajamarca, Peru.
== Description =="E. brachyglossum" is a sympodial epiphyte with slender, simply-branching or paired stems which produce thick roots from a short section at the base.
The stems are covered in loose, dry sheaths and bear two to several linear-oblong leaves, up to 12 cm × 2 cm, on the upper part.
The elongate inflorescence arises from the apex of the stem, through one or two spathes, and terminates in a many-flowered raceme.
The fleshy flowers are mostly green: the concave obovate-oblong to obovate-oblong sepals a darker shade, and the linear-oblanceolate-acute, three-nerved petals a lighter shade.
The even lighter green trilobate lip is adnate to the column to the apex.
The lateral lobes are erect, and much smaller than the ovate, acute medial lobe, which bears a red-purple callus just past the apex of the column.
Both the column and the ovary have additional red-purple spots.

Epidendrum frigidum is a reed-stemmed "Epidendrum" orchid from the high-altitude tropics in Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela.
The round stem grows from a half to a meter tall.
Like other members of "Epidendrum" subgenus "Euepidendrum" Lindl., the stem is covered by foliaceous sheathes of the distichous leaves.
The leathery leaves are ovate-oblong, obtuse at the end, and curve backward at the edges.
The erect paniculate inflorescence with drooping branches arises from the apex of the stem, without any spathe at the base.
The flowers are pale rose or green.
The rigid sepals and petals do not open widely, but surround the cordate lip which is adnate to the column to its apex and has an entire margin.
The species occurs in Florida, Bahamas, West Indies, Central America to northern Brazil and the Guyanas.
It is usually autogamous (flowers self-pollinate) and sometimes cleistogamous (flowers self-pollinate before they open).
On November 7, 2010, Kew did not recognize the existence of this variety in its World Checklist of Selected Plant Families.

"Spathium", the stems of "E. cristatum" are un-swollen and covered by close, tubular sheathes which bear distichous, somewht leaathery, lanceolate leaves (up to 3 cm long by 4 cm wide) on the upper part of the stem.
The terminal paniculate inflorescence grows through several enlarged spathes, arranged in a fan, which cover the peduncle.
The yellow-green flowers often have purple-brown markings.
The oblong convex obtuse sepals can grow up to 2.8 cm long, slightly longer than the linear petals.
The lip is adnate to the column to its apex with a shape that resembles a comb.
"Spathium", "E. armeniacum" exhibits a sympodial growth habit with the individual stems showing no tendency to swell into pseudobulbs, imbricating foliaceous sheathes covering the stem, an apical peduncle covered at its base by enlarged foliaceous spathes, and a lip adnate to the column to its apex.
The closely spaced, slightly flattened stems bear distichous, narrow, lanceolate, slightly folded, leathery leaves which are darker above than below and pointed at the tip, up to 14 cm long by 1.6 cm wide.
The ovate-acute sepals are 3 mm long, as are the filiform petals, which are slightly dilated distally.
The fleshy, hood-shaped lip has erect, rounded lateral lobes and a pointed midlobe, up to 4 mm long.
The stout column is up to 2 mm long.

Epidendrum brevivenium is a species of "Epidendrum" Orchid native to Peru and the provinces of Pichincha, Napo, and Tungurahua in Ecuador at altitudes of 2.8 to 3.4 km.
The stems are covered with sheaths, the bases of the distichous, oblong-obtuse leaves.
The terminal inflorescence arises from an obtuse spathe and has a short peduncle clothed in distichous, imbricating sheathes below the raceme of light green flowers, 1-2 cm across.
The lateral lobes of the trilobate lip appear to have deep, ragged cuts; the middle lobe divides into three parts at the apex.
The genus is named after orchidologist Robert L. Dressler.
Some species are noted to be pubescent.

They are quite variable in appearance, the nominal subfamily Crambinae (grass moths) taking up closely folded postures on grass-stems where they are inconspicuous, while other subfamilies include brightly colored and patterned insects which rest in wing-spread attitudes.
In many classifications, the Crambidae have been treated as a subfamily of the Pyralidae or snout-moths.
The principal difference is a structure in the ears called the praecinctorium, which joins two tympanic membranes in the Crambidae, and is absent from the Pyralidae.
It would seem to be a matter of personal opinion (therefore not susceptible to definitive decision) whether this distinction merits division into two families, or whether the common presence of ventrally-located ears should unify them into one family.
The latest review by Munroe & Solis, in Kristensen (1999) retains the Crambidae as a full family.

It violates condition 1, and thus introduces a flow dependency.
This is known as parallel slowdown.
This contrasts with data parallelism, where the same calculation is performed on the same or different sets of data.
Task parallelism does not usually scale with the size of a problem.
=====Reconfigurable computing with field-programmable gate arrays=====Reconfigurable computing is the use of a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) as a co-processor to a general-purpose computer.
An FPGA is, in essence, a computer chip that can rewire itself for a given task.
FPGAs can be programmed with hardware description languages such as VHDL or Verilog.
However, programming in these languages can be tedious.
Several vendors have created C to HDL languages that attempt to emulate the syntax and semantics of the C programming language, with which most programmers are familiar.
The best known C to HDL languages are Mitrion-C, Impulse C, DIME-C, and Handel-C.
AMD's decision to open its HyperTransport technology to third-party vendors has become the enabling technology for high-performance reconfigurable computing.
According to Michael R. D'Amour, Chief Operating Officer of DRC Computer Corporation, "when we first walked into AMD, they called us 'the socket stealers.'

To provide modularity, memory and I/O buses can be combined into a unified system bus.
Later computer programs began to share memory common to several CPUs.
Access to this memory bus had to be prioritized, as well.
The simple way to prioritize interrupts or bus access was with a daisy chain.
In this case signals will naturally flow through the bus in physical or logical order, eliminating the need for complex scheduling.
===Minis and micros===Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) further reduced cost for mass-produced minicomputers, and mapped peripherals into the memory bus, so that the input and output devices appeared to be memory locations.
This was implemented in the Unibus of the PDP-11 around 1969.
Early microcomputer bus systems were essentially a passive backplane connected directly or through buffer amplifiers to the pins of the CPU.
Memory and other devices would be added to the bus using the same address and data pins as the CPU itself used, connected in parallel.
Communication was controlled by the CPU, which had read and written data from the devices as if they are blocks of memory, using the same instructions, all timed by a central clock controlling the speed of the CPU.
Still, devices interrupted the CPU by signaling on separate CPU pins.
For instance, a disk drive controller would signal the CPU that new data was ready to be read, at which point the CPU would move the data by reading the "memory location" that corresponded to the disk drive.
Almost all early microcomputers were built in this fashion, starting with the S-100 bus in the Altair 8800 computer system.
In some instances, most notably in the IBM PC, although similar physical architecture can be employed, instructions to access peripherals (codice_1 and codice_2) and memory (codice_3 and others) have not been made uniform at all, and still generate distinct CPU signals, that could be used to implement a separate I/O bus.
These simple bus systems had a serious drawback when used for general-purpose computers.
All the equipment on the bus has to talk at the same speed, as it shared a single clock.
Increasing the speed of the CPU becomes harder, because the speed of all the devices must increase as well.
When it is not practical or economical to have all devices as fast as the CPU, the CPU must either enter a wait state, or work at a slower clock frequency temporarily, to talk to other devices in the computer.
While acceptable in embedded systems, this problem was not tolerated for long in general-purpose, user-expandable computers.
Such bus systems are also difficult to configure when constructed from common off-the-shelf equipment.
Typically each added expansion card requires many jumpers in order to set memory addresses, I/O addresses, interrupt priorities, and interrupt numbers.
This led to much better "real world" performance, but also required the cards to be much more complex.
These buses also often addressed speed issues by being "bigger" in terms of the size of the data path, moving from 8-bit parallel buses in the first generation, to 16 or 32-bit in the second, as well as adding software setup (now standardised as Plug-n-play) to supplant or replace the jumpers.
However these newer systems shared one quality with their earlier cousins, in that everyone on the bus had to talk at the same speed.
The result was that the bus speeds were now very much slower than what a modern system needed, and the machines were left starved for data.
A particularly common example of this problem was that video cards quickly outran even the newer bus systems like PCI, and computers began to include AGP just to drive the video card.
By 2004 AGP was outgrown again by high-end video cards and other peripherals and has been replaced by the new PCI Express bus.
An increasing number of external devices started employing their own bus systems as well.
When disk drives were first introduced, they would be added to the machine with a card plugged into the bus, which is why computers have so many slots on the bus.
But through the 1980s and 1990s, new systems like SCSI and IDE were introduced to serve this need, leaving most slots in modern systems empty.
Today there are likely to be about five different buses in the typical machine, supporting various devices.

Popper believed that Marxism had been initially scientific, in that Marx had postulated a theory which was genuinely predictive.
When Marx's predictions were not in fact borne out, Popper argues that the theory was saved from falsification by the addition of "ad hoc" hypotheses which attempted to make it compatible with the facts.
By this means a theory which was initially genuinely scientific degenerated into pseudo-scientific dogma.

Significant compression of hydrogen gas occurs that leads to the development of starbirth regions.
In pictures of M51 these show up as the bright blue 'knots' throughout the spiral arms.
Generally speaking, hydrogen gas is the most common component of the interstellar medium (the vast space between stars and planetary systems in galaxies).
It exists primarily in its atomic structure and molecular form, and forms huge clouds throughout the entire galaxy.
When large sources of gravitational pull pass nearby, such as other galaxies, gravitational interactions produce compression (density) waves that sweep through these hydrogen clouds.
This causes some regions of the previously diffuse gas to compress into tight pockets of opaque and dense gas; these are dust lanes one so often sees in the spiral arms.
In regions where the concentration and density of gas reaches a critical value, further collapse under its own gravitational pull occurs, and stars are born at the center of the collapse, where the gas is compressed so strongly that fusion initiates.
When this happens, these new-born stars consume huge amounts of gas causing them to expand, shine even hotter, and finally sweep away the surrounding layers of dust and gas by increasing efflux of the stellar wind.
The gigantic proportions of the clouds out of which they are born means stars seldom, if ever, are created in isolation.
Thus regions of several hot young stars emit sufficient light energy that they can be seen in the high resolution pictures of M51 across millions of lightyears distance.
For an example of such a formation in our own galaxy, see M16, the Eagle Nebula.
This small group may actually be a subclump at the southeast end of a large, elongated group that includes the M101 Group and the NGC 5866 Group, although most group identification methods and catalogs identify the three groups as separate entities.

In 1927 "Nothofagus nuda" was reported by J.R. Croft to account for 949 deaths throughout Papua New Guinea.
The plant is traditionally used as an herb in culinary dishes throughout the Puri Puri tribes of the Papua New Guinea highlands but results in hypoglycemic shock after ingestion of large doses.
Croft reported that wives within the polygamous tribes of the Puri Puri used the herb to poison the patriarchs during tribal disputes that coincided with the winter solstice.
Scientists in Macao Laboratory isolated the active molecule of the plant in late 2006.
The molecule was determined to be an IRS-1 adaptor molecule involved the insulin response cascade.

Eburodacrys luederwaldti is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae.
Eburodacrys nemorivaga is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae.
It is less-frequently known as Rose's Short-headed Frog, Rose's Blaasop, or the Sand Rain Frog.
Some consider Breviceps fasciatus as synonym of this species, although other authorities have expressed doubt.
Frogs in this species spend most of their lives in subterranean nests under sandy ground, where they lay their eggs.
They surface during heavy rain.
Tadpoles develop inside the eggs and hatch as fully formed baby frogs.
Despite this, its future seems secure, as it is very adaptable and remains locally abundant.

The hatchlings emerge after 2.5 to 3 months and are about 30 cm (12 inches) in length.
==Uses==The species is kept as an exotic pet.
They are often regarded as unpredictable and aggressive, but captive bred individuals tend to be more docile than wild-caught specimens.
The blood python has been extensively harvested for leather, an estimated 100 000 individuals are taken for this purpose each year.
The commercial trade regards this as a single species.
Authors who elevate these island populations to species note that skins are readily distinguished.

The agreement stated that only Soviet and Chinese citizens could be employed by the CER.
This meant the Harbin Russians had to choose not only their nationality, but also their political identity.
Many Harbin Russians took Soviet citizenship for patriotic reasons.
However, there were also Harbin Russians who remained stateless, who were eventually let go from CER.
Gradually, the national and the political identity of the Harbin Russians split the group into opposing sides.
This led to a strong Soviet Union presence in Harbin.

Its dental formula is 2.1.2.3/2.1.2.3, the generalized formula for Old World monkeys and apes.
The dental arcade is U-shaped, and the mandible is thin and light.
The incisors are broad and flat, while the molars have low, rounded cusps with thick enamel.
The most noticeable characteristic of the dentition of "Hylobates lar" is the presence of large, dagger-like canines in both the upper and lower jaw.
These canines are not sexually dimorphic.
They rarely come to the ground, instead using their long arms to brachiate through the trees.
With their hooked hands, they can move swiftly with great momentum, swinging from the branches.
When a juvenile reaches sexual maturity, it is expelled from the family unit.
However, this traditional conception has come under scrutiny.
Long-term studies conducted in Khao Yai National Park in Thailand suggest their mating system is somewhat flexible, incorporating extra-pair copulations, partner changes and polyandrous groupings.
===Vocalisations===Family groups inhabit a firm territory, which they protect by warding off other gibbons with their calls.
Each species has a typified call and each breeding pair has unique variations on that theme.
The great call of "Hylobates lar" is characterized by its frequent use of short hoots with more complex hoots, along with a "quavering" opening and closing.
These calls are one of the traits used determining species differences among the gibbons.
Young are nursed for approximately two years, and full maturity comes at about eight years.
The life expectancy of the lar gibbons in the wild is about 25 years.

Due to the limited time between matches, the draws for the second and third qualifying rounds take place before the results of the previous round are known.
The seeding in each draw is carried out under the assumption that all of the highest-ranked clubs of the previous round are victorious.
If a lower-ranked club is victorious, it simply takes the place of its defeated opponent in the next round.
Moreover, in the third qualifying round and play-off round, champion clubs and non-champion clubs are kept separated.
In the draw for the first knockout stage, the eight group winners are seeded, and the eight group runners-up are unseeded.
Teams from the same group or the same association cannot be drawn against each other.
In the draws for the quarter-finals onwards, there are no seedings, and teams from the same group or the same association may be drawn with each other.

It was named in honor of Myron Gordon by Robert Rush Miller and W. L. Minckley who discovered it with Carl Hubbs on a 1961 expedition.
Its natural habitat is a hot spring heated by volcanic activity, in Santa Tecla, Mexico.
The water is "shallow, sulphur smelling", and vegetation choked.
"Water temperatures in its biotope range from the mid 80s to the high 90s", making it difficult for all but the most dedicated aquarists to keep it in captivity.
Due to canal construction at the spring, it is not known if a viable wild population survives, or if the fish has used the canals to extend its range.

Adult "S. alascanus" live predominantly in the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ), and thus require specific adaptations/exaptations in order to overcome the problems posed by the extremely low levels of oxygen saturation.
Allowing for an increased ventilation frequency during exposure to progressively hypoxic conditions, as compared to its more shallow relative "Scorpaena guttata", enables "S. alascanus" to compensate for the inherent low concentrations of oxygen in the OMZ.
Further, heightened levels of lactate dehydrogenase, specifically the anaerobic isoform- LDH-A in the heart and muscles of "S. alascanus", suggests an adaptive mechanism for ATP production during low oxygen availability.

Moneilema gigas is a large, flightless, black beetle native to the Sonoran desert at elevations below 1500 metres.
The front wings are fused forming a single, hardened shell.
"M. gigas" normally feeds on chollas and prickly pear cacti, and is known to feed on saguaro seedlings.
Larvae bore into cactus roots and stems, sometimes killing more susceptible individuals.
Adults also feed on the surface of cacti.
"M. gigas" are most active during mid or late summer - the adults typically emerging during the summer monsoon season.
Like many flightless beetles, these beetles have limited wing musculature with a rounded abdomen and thorax, similar in appearance to a number of other flightless desert beetles.
Cactus longhorn beetles resemble and mimic the behavior of noxious stink beetles in the genus "Eleodes".

The Black-kneed Duskhawker (Gynacantha bullata) is a very widespread species, however deforestation is a threat in parts of its range and the impacts of this needs to be monitored.
At present, it is not thought that this will cause the global population to decline at a sufficient rate to qualify or nearly qualify the species for a threatened category under criterion A; therefore it is assessed as Least Concern.

The plant tends to be taller and have more biomass if it is well-watered.
The plant requires a sunny area to grow in.
The leaves are glabrous (smooth) and acuminate in shape, with entire (smooth) edges.
The veins in the leaves are pinnate.
The plant terminates in a dichotomous cyme, with a peduncle supporting each flower.
The floral leaves are bifid (split in two parts) and ovate, while the involucral bracts are bright red, irregularly acuminate in shape (e.g., like a slipper), and about in length with a long, thin tube.
The flower is void of scent.
The male pedicel is hairy, while the female is glabrous.
The seed pod is about long and wide, and ovoid in shape (with truncated ends).
The plant generally flowers in mid-spring.
If latex or root juice gets on the skin, the victim should immediately wash with soap and warm water.
Topical steroids are indicated for skin or eye contact.
Intravenous fluids are often administered to counteract the fluid loss due to vomiting and diarrhea.
In 1995, a galactose-specific lectin was purified from the plant's latex, and indications are that it might be useful in combatting diabetes mellitus.
In folk medicine, tea has been brewed from the leaves which has been used to treat asthma, persistent coughing, laryngitis, mouth ulcers, and venereal disease.
Tea brewed from the root has been used as an abortifacient.
The latex has been used topically to treat calluses, ear ache, insect stings, ringworm, skin cancer, toothache, umbilical hernias, and warts.
None of these uses has been scientifically verified as effective.
In the West Indies, a few drops of the latex is added to milk and used as an emetic.
It is sometimes added to drinks made from mescaline-containing Trichocereus cacti (although "Euphorbia tithymaloides" has no known psychoactive properties).

*"Cattleya × zayrae" V.P.Castro & Cath (Bahia, Brazil)== Hybrids ==Cattleyas have been hybridized both within the genus and with related genera for more than a century, but the last several decades have seen a remarkable increase in both the quantity and quality of the hybrids within the "Cattleya" alliance.
Among the most popular are the Brassolaeliocattleya (Blc.)
and Sophrolaeliocattleya (Slc.)
The vast majority of the Blc.
hybrids have recently been moved into the new nothogenus Rhyncholaeliocattleya (Rlc.
); the Slc.
"Laelia" (L.): Breeding with this genus refines the lip of the orchid, producing a more elongated closed "cone" that gracefully opens into the full lip of the blossom.
These are usually the largest of the major cattleya hybrids.
Most, but not all, of these hybrids are now placed in Rhyncholaeliocattleya.
): A tiny, flame-colored orchid that introduces the most intense red color to its descendants.
Many crimson and scarlet cattleya hybrids betray sophronitis in their ancestry.
Potinaras are not as popular as Blc's or Slc's, but there are some incredible examples coming in all ranges of colors from light green to magenta.
Although it is not a rule, they are generally smaller than Blc's but larger than Slc's.
The recent merging of "Sophronitis" into "Cattleya" extinguished the nothogenus Potinara; most former Potinaras are now in the nothogenus Rhyncholaeliocattleya (Rlc.)
The addition of "Epidendrum" appears to increase flower yield, and some Yamadaras are intensely colored.
With the recent discovery that the first Yamadara was registered as Adamara, the nothogeneric epithet Yamadara has been extinguished and replaced with Adamara.
Smaller, often magenta/reddish flowers.
Many of these are now classified in the nothogenus Cattleytonia (Ctna.)

=== Sigmatropic reactions ===A sigmatropic rearrangement is a reaction in which a sigma bond moves across a conjugated pi system with a concomitant shift in the pi bonds.
The shift in the sigma bond may be antarafacial or suprafacial.
For an antarafacial shift, the reaction is not allowed.
These results can be predicted with FMO theory by observing the interaction between the HOMO and LUMO of the species.
To use FMO theory, the reaction should be considered as two separate ideas: (1) whether or not the reaction is allowed, and (2) which mechanism the reaction proceeds though.
a constructive bond) and the LUMO of butadiene on the remaining 4 carbons is observed.
Assuming the reaction happens suprafacially, the shift results with the HOMO of butadiene on the 4 carbons that are not involved in the sigma bond of the product.
Since the pi system changed from the LUMO to the HOMO, this reaction is allowed (though it would not be allowed if the pi system went from LUMO to LUMO).
To explain why the reaction happens suprafacially, first notice that the terminal orbitals are in the same phase.
For there to be a constructive sigma bond formed after the shift, the reaction would have to be suprafacial.
If the species shifted antarafacially then it would form an antibonding orbital and there would not be a constructive sigma shift.
It is worth noting that in propene the shift would have to be antarafacial, but since the molecule is very small that twist is not possible and the reaction is not allowed.
=== Electrocyclic reactions ===An electrocyclic reaction is a pericyclic reaction involving the net loss of a pi bond and creation of a sigma bond with formation of a ring.
This reaction proceeds through either a conrotatory or disrotatory mechanism.
In the conrotatory ring opening of cyclobutene, there are two electrons moving suprafacially (on the pi bond) and two moving antarafacially (on the sigma bond).
The HOMO of the sigma bond (i.e.
a constructive bond) and the LUMO of the pi bond are important in the FMO theory consideration.
If the ring opening uses a conrotatory process then the reaction results with the HOMO of butadiene.
As in the previous examples the pi system moves from a LUMO species to a HOMO species, meaning this reaction is allowed.

Logisticus simplex is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae.
The commune is a ski resort and owes its name to the river which runs through it.
The inhabitants of Le Grand-Bornand are called Bornandins.
==Geography==Located on the western slope of the Aravis mountain range not far from Mont Blanc, Annecy Lake and Switzerland, Le Grand-Bornand is a summer and winter resort which developed around an old village.
Le Grand-Bornand is in a wide part of the valley which has allowed it to develop - the village of Petit-Bornand, located downstream, is in a narrower part of the valley.
The commune of Le Grand-Bornand is made-up of three areas: the Bouchet valley, the Chinaillon valley and the village of Le Grand-Bornand located at the junction of the two valleys.
The valley of Bouchet is located upstream of the village along the course of the river Borne.
==Nearby==Nearby villages include Manigod, Thônes, La Clusaz, Saint-Jean-de-Sixt and the larger Chamonix and Annecy.
44 were buried in a cemetery created on the spot in the Bouchet valley.
Several were younger than 18 and at least one had never been part of the militia.
* 14 July 1987: A brutal and unforeseeable flood of the Borne river, following a violent storm over the mountain, submerges the valley and devastates in particular the campsite of Le Grand-Bornand.
There 21 fatalities and two missing persons.
The commune and the State were forced to compensate the families of the victims as the campsite had been located on the river floodplain.
===Place names===Researcher toponymist and Ph.D. graduate of the Sorbonne, Jérémie Delorme, has listed, photographed and described, about 3 000 place names in the commune.
90% come from Latin, 8% come from Gaulish, 1% from Germanic and 1% from pre-Latin languages.
A third of the names refer to former occupants.

After harvesting, stems are decorticated while the plants are fresh.
If this is not done while the plants are still fresh the plants will dry out and the bark will be hard to remove.
The bark ribbon is then dried as quickly as possible.
This will prevent bacteria and fungi from attacking it.
The dry weight of harvested stem from crops ranges from 3.4 to 4.5 t/ha/year, so a 4.5 ton crop yields 1,600 kg/ha/year of dry non-de-gummed fiber.
The weight loss during de-gumming can be up to 25% giving a yield of de-gummed fiber of about 1,200 kg/ha/year.
The extraction of the fiber occurs in three stages.
First the cortex or bark is removed; this can be done by hand or by machine.
This process is called de-cortication.
Second the cortex is scraped to remove most of the outer bark, the parenchyma in the bast layer and some of the gums and pectins.
Finally the residual cortex material is washed, dried, and de-gummed to extract the spinnable fiber.
The outermost cloth was heavy and coarsely woven; the innermost was the lightest and most tightly woven.
The outer cloth appeared to be ramie (which Wiseman notes "contains non-fibrous material that is toxic to bacteria and fungi"—in other words, an ideal textile for mummymaking).
Farmers in ancient China are also known to have used the fiber to weave clothing.
Ramie was used to produce an open weave fabric called mechera, used for shirts and dressing gowns suitable for warm climates.
The French painter Raoul Dufy designed in the early 20th century patterns for prints on mechera used by the French shirtmaker Charvet.
Brazil began production in the late 1930s with production peaking in 1971.
Since then, production has steadily declined as a result of competition with alternative crops, such as soybeans and the important synthetic fibers.
==Properties==Ramie is one of the strongest natural fibers.
It exhibits even greater strength when wet.
Ramie fiber is known especially for its ability to hold shape, reduce wrinkling, and introduce a silky lustre to the fabric appearance.
It is not as durable as other fibers, and so is usually used as a blend with other fibers such as cotton or wool.
It is similar to linen in absorbency, density and microscopic appearance.
However it will not dye as well as cotton.
Because of its high molecular crystallinity, ramie is stiff and brittle and will break if folded repeatedly in the same place; it lacks resiliency and is low in elasticity and elongation potential.

Star dunes are formed by variable winds, and have several ridges and slip faces radiating from a central point.
They tend to grow vertically; they can reach a height of , making them the tallest type of dune.
Rounded mounds of sand without a slip face are the rare dome dunes, found on the upwind edges of sand seas.
Carnivores can obtain much of their water needs from the body fluids of their prey.
The water holding frog in Australia has a similar life cycle and may aestivate for as long as five years if no rain falls.

Upper-crust granite-and-greenstone terrains underwent moderate regional shortening, decoupled from the lower crust, during compositional inversion accompanying doming, but cratonization soon followed.
Tonalitic basement is preserved beneath some greenstone sections but supracrustal rocks commonly give way downward to correlative or younger plutonic rocks... Mantle plumes probably did not yet exist, and developing continents were concentrated in cool regions.
Hot-region upper mantle was partly molten, and voluminous magmas, mostly ultramafic, erupted through many ephemeral submarine vents and rifts focussed at the thinnest crust...
Surviving Archean crust is from regions of cooler, and more depleted, mantle, wherein greater stability permitted uncommonly thick volcanic accumulations from which voluminous partial-melt, low-density felsic rocks could be generated.

While many were criticized, Elina was chosen as the winner, and got to shoot a holiday fashion spread for Seventeen along with Analeigh and Marjorie.
The following day, the girls met Cycle 10 winner Whitney Thompson for a CoverGirl commercial shoot.
Analeigh was praised highly, with Tyra stating that her commercial was the best ever in ANTM history.
Sheena was also praised for her personality in the commercial.
That evening, the girls let loose when they invited their go-sees boatmen from the previous episode to the house.
The photo shoot took place in the Dutch countryside, with windmills as the backdrop accompanied by dramatic hair and makeup.
At judging, Samantha was again criticized for her unprofessional appearance and for having a bad film overall despite producing a good photo.
Samantha's commercial lacked energy while Analeigh went blank and had to be fed the lines.
McKey produced a stunning commercial, improving immensely from her first commercial performance.
Afterwards, all the girls shot their CoverGirl print ads with Jim De Yonker.
Both girls showed consistent walks, although both were critiqued that they were not as strong as they could have been.
During deliberation, the judges recognized that both girls had stunning portfolios, and had greatly improved as models from their first shoot.

Ivanovic immediately recovered her break, and eventually kept her serve at 5–4, to close the first set on the score of 6–4.
Ivanovic broke the Russian for a 2–1 lead in the second set, and continued to dominate Safina up to the seventh game, where she held double-break balls at 4–2.
Af the end of this long game, in which both players repeatedly took and lost the advantage, Safina ultimately kept her serve, but the Russian was unable to attack Ivanovic in the following game, and found herself serving to stay in the match at 3–5.
The Serbian pressured Safina, and eventually broke her a final time, to win the match on the score of 6–4, 6–3, after ninety-eight minutes of play.
Both players received their trophies from the hands of former World No.
1 and 2003, 2005, 2006, and 2007 French Open champion Justine Henin in the awards ceremony that followed, which crowned Ivanovic, a first-time Grand Slam winner, as the new Roland-Garros women's singles champion.

1 and holder of twelve Grand Slam titles, Roger Federer, and ATP No.
2 Rafael Nadal, the winner in Roland-Garros since 2005.
Federer decided to serve after being given the choice, but the Spaniard immediately attacked the Swiss' serve, and broke him, winning his own service game to quickly open a 2–0 lead.
Though Federer won his following serve, he was not able in the rest of the set to convert the few break points he had on Nadal's serve, or win his own service games, allowing the Spaniard to close the first set in thirty-two minutes, on the score of 6–1.
Despite being broken in the beginning of the second set, Federer started to fight back, as he finally took Nadal's serve, came back to 2–2, and held to 3–3.
After a long game on Federer's serve, Nadal finally broke once more, and rapidly finished the set on the score of 6–3, after forty-nine minutes.
There was no competition in what would become the final set as Nadal left no chances to Federer, and the Swiss was not able to find a second breath to start a comeback, not winning any game in the twenty-seven minutes set, and suffering a bagel for the first time in a Grand Slam since a 1999 Roland-Garros first round loss to Pat Rafter.
Particularly relevant to the outcome of their meeting were Federer's thirty-five unforced errors to Nadal's seven during the brief match which never allowed him to gain a foothold.
Rafael Nadal claimed his fourth consecutive French Open crown, on the final score of 6–1, 6–3, 6–0, and in becoming the 2008 French Open champion equalled Björn Borg's record of four straight Roland-Garros titles, and extended his win-loss record at the tournament to 28–0.

Although such proponents of the atomic theory as Amedeo Avogadro and Ludwig Boltzmann made great advances in explaining the behavior of gases, this dispute was not finally settled until Jean Perrin's experimental investigation of Einstein's atomic explanation of Brownian motion in the first decade of the 20th century.
Well before the dispute had been settled, many had already applied the concept of atomism to chemistry.
A major example was the ion theory of Svante Arrhenius which anticipated ideas about atomic substructure that did not fully develop until the 20th century.
Michael Faraday was another early worker, whose major contribution to chemistry was electrochemistry, in which (among other things) a certain quantity of electricity during electrolysis or electrodeposition of metals was shown to be associated with certain quantities of chemical elements, and fixed quantities of the elements therefore with each other, in specific ratios.
These findings, like those of Dalton's combining ratios, were early clues to the atomic nature of matter.
However, the 1927 article of Walter Heitler and Fritz London is often recognised as the first milestone in the history of quantum chemistry.
This is the first application of quantum mechanics to the diatomic hydrogen molecule, and thus to the phenomenon of the chemical bond.
In the following years much progress was accomplished by Edward Teller, Robert S. Mulliken, Max Born, J. Robert Oppenheimer, Linus Pauling, Erich Hückel, Douglas Hartree, Vladimir Aleksandrovich Fock, to cite a few.
Still, skepticism remained as to the general power of quantum mechanics applied to complex chemical systems.
In 1951, a milestone article in quantum chemistry is the seminal paper of Clemens C. J. Roothaan on Roothaan equations.
It opened the avenue to the solution of the self-consistent field equations for small molecules like hydrogen or nitrogen.
Those computations were performed with the help of tables of integrals which were computed on the most advanced computers of the time.
However, though some principles deduced from quantum mechanics were able to predict qualitatively some chemical features for biologically relevant molecules, they were, till the end of the 20th century, more a collection of rules, observations, and recipes than rigorous ab initio quantitative methods.
This heuristic approach triumphed in 1953 when James Watson and Francis Crick deduced the double helical structure of DNA by constructing models constrained by and informed by the knowledge of the chemistry of the constituent parts and the X-ray diffraction patterns obtained by Rosalind Franklin.
This discovery lead to an explosion of research into the biochemistry of life.
In the same year, the Miller–Urey experiment demonstrated that basic constituents of protein, simple amino acids, could themselves be built up from simpler molecules in a simulation of primordial processes on Earth.
Though many questions remain about the true nature of the origin of life, this was the first attempt by chemists to study hypothetical processes in the laboratory under controlled conditions.
In 1983 Kary Mullis devised a method for the in-vitro amplification of DNA, known as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which revolutionized the chemical processes used in the laboratory to manipulate it.
PCR could be used to synthesize specific pieces of DNA and made possible the sequencing of DNA of organisms, which culminated in the huge human genome project.
They used a centrifugation technique that sorted molecules according to differences in weight.
Because nitrogen atoms are a component of DNA, they were labelled and therefore tracked in replication in bacteria.
===Chemical industry===The later part of the nineteenth century saw a huge increase in the exploitation of petroleum extracted from the earth for the production of a host of chemicals and largely replaced the use of whale oil, coal tar and naval stores used previously.
Large-scale production and refinement of petroleum provided feedstocks for liquid fuels such as gasoline and diesel, solvents, lubricants, asphalt, waxes, and for the production of many of the common materials of the modern world, such as synthetic fibers, plastics, paints, detergents, pharmaceuticals, adhesives and ammonia as fertilizer and for other uses.
Many of these required new catalysts and the utilization of chemical engineering for their cost-effective production.
In the mid-twentieth century, control of the electronic structure of semiconductor materials was made precise by the creation of large ingots of extremely pure single crystals of silicon and germanium.
Accurate control of their chemical composition by doping with other elements made the production of the solid state transistor in 1951 and made possible the production of tiny integrated circuits for use in electronic devices, especially computers.

Therefore, many things only become apparent once a certain amount of work has been done on a new system, allowing a user to experience it.
This experience will yield insights, which will change a user's needs or the perception of the user's needs.
The system should, therefore, be changed to fulfill the changed requirements of the user.
This can only occur up to a certain point, otherwise the system may never be completed.
All requests for changes should be delayed until the "next" version of the system.

Placoclytus distortus is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae.
Sony BMG.
Placoclytus championi is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae.
The title of sultan was used continuously by all rulers almost from the beginning.
However, because it was widespread in the Muslim world, the Ottomans quickly adopted variations of it to dissociate themselves from other Muslim rulers of lesser status.
Murad I, the third Ottoman monarch, styled himself "sultan-i azam" (, the most exalted sultan) and "hüdavendigar" (, emperor), titles used by the Anatolian Seljuqs and the Mongol Ilkhanids respectively.
His son Bayezid I adopted the style "Sultan of Rûm", Rûm being an old Islamic name for Anatolia.
The combining of the Islamic and Central Asian heritages of the Ottomans led to the adoption of the title that became the standard designation of the Ottoman ruler: "Sultan Khan".
Ironically, although the title of sultan is most often associated in the Western world with the Ottomans, people within Turkey generally use the title of "padishah" far more frequently when referring to rulers of the Ottoman Dynasty.
The caliphate symbolized their spiritual power, whereas the sultanate represented their temporal power.
It is currently agreed that the caliphate "disappeared" for two-and-a-half centuries, before being revived with the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca, signed between the Ottoman Empire and Catherine II of Russia in 1774.
The treaty was highly symbolic, since it marked the first international recognition of the Ottomans' claim to the caliphate.
Although the treaty officialised the Ottoman Empire's loss of the Crimean Khanate, it acknowledged the Ottoman caliph's continuing religious authority over Muslims in Russia.
From the 18th century onwards, Ottoman sultans increasingly emphasized their status as caliphs in order to stir Pan-Islamist sentiments among the empire's Muslims in the face of encroaching European imperialism.
When World War I broke out, the sultan/caliph issued a call for "jihad" in 1914 against the Ottoman Empire's Allied enemies, vainly inciting the subjects of the French, British and Russian empires to revolt.
Abdülhamid II was by far the Ottoman sultan who made the most use of his caliphal position, and was recognized as caliph by many Muslim heads of state, even as far away as Sumatra.
He had his claim to the title inserted into the 1876 Constitution (Article 4).
:c: Tughras were used by 35 out of 36 Ottoman sultans, starting with Orhan in the 14th century, whose tughra has been found on two different documents.
No tughra bearing the name of Osman I, the founder of the empire, has ever been discovered, although a coin with the inscription "Osman bin Ertuğrul bin Gündüz Alp" has been identified.
Abdülmecid II, the last Ottoman caliph, also lacked a tughra of his own, since he did not serve as head of state (that position being held by Mustafa Kemal, President of the newly founded Republic of Turkey) but as a religious and royal figurehead.
:d: The Ottoman Interregnum, also known as the Ottoman Triumvirate (), was a period of chaos in the Ottoman Empire which lasted from 1402 to 1413.
It started following the defeat and capture of Bayezid I by the Turco-Mongol warlord Tamerlane at the Battle of Ankara, which was fought on 20 July 1402.
Bayezid's sons fought each other for over a decade, until Mehmed I emerged as the undisputed victor in 1413.:e: The dissolution of the Ottoman Empire was a gradual process which started with the abolition of the sultanate and ended with that of the caliphate 16 months later.
On 18 November, the Grand National Assembly (TBMM) elected Mehmed VI's cousin Abdülmecid II, the then crown prince, as caliph.
The official end of the Ottoman State was declared through the Treaty of Lausanne (24 July 1923), which recognized the new "Ankara government," and not the old Istanbul-based Ottoman government, as representing the rightful owner and successor state.
Although Abdülmecid II was a figurehead lacking any political power, he remained in his position of caliph until the office of the caliphate was abolished by the TBMM on 3 March 1924.
Mehmed VI later tried unsuccessfully to reinstall himself as caliph in the Hejaz.

Lacking military discipline, in what likely seemed to the participants a strange land (Eastern Europe), Peter's fledgling army quickly found itself in trouble despite the fact they were still in Christian territory.
The army led by Walter fought with the Hungarians over food at Belgrade, but otherwise arrived in Constantinople unharmed.
Meanwhile, the army led by Peter, which marched separately from Walter's army, also fought with the Hungarians, and may have captured Belgrade.
At Nish the Byzantine governor tried to supply them, but Peter had little control over his followers and Byzantine troops were needed to quell their attacks.
Peter arrived at Constantinople in August, where his army joined with the one led by Walter, which had already arrived, as well as separate bands of crusaders from France, Germany, and Italy.
Another army of Bohemians and Saxons did not make it past Hungary before splitting up.
This unruly mob began to attack and pillage outside the city in search of supplies and food, prompting Alexios to hurriedly ferry the gathering across the Bosporus one week later.
After crossing into Asia Minor, the crusaders split up and began to pillage the countryside, wandering into Seljuq territory around Nicaea.
The greater experience of the Turks was overwhelming; most of this group of the crusaders were massacred.
Some Italian and German crusaders were defeated and killed at Xerigordon at the end of August.
Meanwhile, Walter and Peter's followers, who, although for the most part untrained in battle but led by about 50 knights, fought a battle against the Turks at Civitot in October.
The Turkish archers destroyed the crusader army, and Walter was among the dead.
Peter, who was absent in Constantinople at the time, later joined the main crusader army, along with the few survivors of Civetot.

Often the Shikken was also the Tokuso and Rensho.
==Number of tones==Languages may distinguish up to five levels of pitch, though the Chori language of Nigeria is described as distinguishing six surface tone registers.
Since tone contours may involve up to two shifts in pitch, there are theoretically 5 × 5 × 5 = 125 distinct tones for a language with five registers.
However, the most that are actually used in a language is a tenth of that number.
Preliminary work on the Wobe language of Liberia and Côte d'Ivoire, and the Chatino languages of southern Mexico suggests that some dialects may distinguish as many as fourteen tones, but many linguists have expressed doubts, believing that many of these will turn out to be sequences of tones or prosodic effects.
==Origin==André-Georges Haudricourt established that Vietnamese tone originated in earlier consonantal contrasts, and suggested similar mechanisms for Chinese.
It is now widely held that Old Chinese did not have phonemically contrastive tone.
The historical origin of tone is called "tonogenesis," a term coined by James Matisoff.
Tone is frequently an areal rather than a genealogical feature.
That is, a language may acquire tones through bilingualism if influential neighboring languages are tonal, or if speakers of a tonal language shift to the language in question, and bring their tones with them.
In other cases, tone may arise spontaneously, and surprisingly quickly: the dialect of Cherokee in Oklahoma has tone, but the dialect in North Carolina does not, although they were only separated in 1838.
Very often, tone arises as an effect of the loss or merger of consonants.
(Such trace effects of disappeared tones or other sounds have been nicknamed Cheshirisation, after the lingering smile of the disappearing Cheshire Cat in "Alice in Wonderland.")
In a non-tonal language, voiced consonants commonly cause following vowels to be pronounced at a lower pitch than other consonants do.
This is usually a minor phonetic detail of voicing.
However, if consonant voicing is subsequently lost, that incidental pitch difference may be left over to carry the distinction that the voicing had carried, and thus becomes meaningful (phonemic).
If the murmured consonant was at the beginning of a word, it left behind a low tone; if at the end, a high tone.
If there was no such consonant, the pitch was unaffected; however, the unaffected words are limited in pitch so as not to interfere with the low and high tones, and so has become a tone of its own: mid tone.
The historical connection is so regular that Punjabi is still written as if it had murmured consonants, and tone is not marked: the written consonants tell the reader which tone to use.
Similarly, final fricatives or other consonants may phonetically affect the pitch of preceding vowels, and if they then weaken to /h/ and finally disappear completely, the difference in pitch, now a true difference in tone, carries on in their stead.
This was the case with the Chinese languages: Two of the three tones of Middle Chinese, the "rising" and "departing" tones, arose as the Old Chinese final consonants and disappeared, while syllables that ended with neither of these consonants were interpreted as carrying the third tone, "even".
The same changes affected many other languages in the same area, and at around the same time (AD 1000–1500).
The tone split, for example, also occurred in Thai, Vietnamese, and the Lhasa dialect of Tibetan.
In general, voiced initial consonants lead to low tones, while vowels after aspirated consonants acquire a high tone.
When final consonants are lost, a glottal stop tends to leave a preceding vowel with a high or rising tone (although glottalized vowels tend to be low tone, so if the glottal stop causes vowel glottalization, that will tend to leave behind a low vowel), whereas a final fricative tends to leave a preceding vowel with a low or falling tone.
Vowel phonation also frequently develops into tone, as can be seen in the case of Burmese.
Tone arose in the Athabascan languages at least twice, in a patchwork of two systems.
In some languages, such as Navajo, syllables with glottalized consonants (including glottal stops) in the syllable coda developed low tones, whereas in others, such as Slavey, they developed high tones, so that the two tonal systems are almost mirror images of each other.
Syllables without glottalized codas developed the opposite tone—for example, high tone in Navajo and low tone in Slavey, due to contrast with the tone triggered by the glottalization.
Other Athabascan languages, namely those in western Alaska (such as Koyukon) and the Pacific coast (such as Hupa), did not develop tone.
Kingston (2005) provides a phonetic explanation for the opposite development of tone based on the two different ways of producing glottalized consonants with either (a) tense voice on the preceding vowel, which tends to produce a high F0, or (b) creaky voice, which tends to produce a low F0.
Languages with "stiff" glottalized consonants and tense voice developed high tone on the preceding vowel and those with "slack" glottalized consonants with creaky voice developed low tone.
The Bantu languages also have "mirror" tone systems, where the languages in the northwest corner of the Bantu area have the opposite tones of other Bantu languages.
Three Algonquian languages developed tone independently of each other and of neighboring languages: Cheyenne, Arapaho, and Kickapoo.
In Cheyenne, tone arose via vowel contraction; the long vowels of Proto-Algonquian contracted into high-pitched vowels in Cheyenne, while the short vowels became low-pitched.
In Kickapoo, a vowel with a following acquired a low tone, and this tone later extended to all vowels followed by a fricative.

Michelangelo's mother was Francesca di Neri del Miniato di Siena.
However, in the Roman manner, "ab Nativitate", it is 1475.:b.
Sources disagree as to how old Michelangelo was when he departed for school.
De Tolnay writes that it was at ten years old while Sedgwick notes in her translation of Condivi that Michelangelo was seven.
Filippo Strozzi sold it to Francis I in 1529.
In 1594, Henry IV installed it in the Jardin d'Estang at Fontainebleau where it disappeared in 1713 when the Jardin d'Estange was destroyed.
:d. Vasari makes no mention of this episode and Paolo Giovio's "Life of Michelangelo" indicates that Michelangelo tried to pass the statue off as an antique himself.

The term geohydrology is often used interchangeably.
Some make the minor distinction between a hydrologist or engineer applying themselves to geology (geohydrology), and a geologist applying themselves to hydrology (hydrogeology).
==Introduction==Hydrogeology is an interdisciplinary subject; it can be difficult to account fully for the chemical, physical, biological and even legal interactions between soil, water, nature and society.
The study of the interaction between groundwater movement and geology can be quite complex.
Groundwater does not always flow in the subsurface down-hill following the surface topography; groundwater follows pressure gradients (flow from high pressure to low) often following fractures and conduits in circuitous paths.
Taking into account the interplay of the different facets of a multi-component system often requires knowledge in several diverse fields at both the experimental and theoretical levels.
The following is a more traditional introduction to the methods and nomenclature of saturated subsurface hydrology, or simply the study of ground water content.
The very shallow flow of water in the subsurface (the upper 3 m or 10 ft) is pertinent to the fields of soil science, agriculture and civil engineering, as well as to hydrogeology.
The general flow of fluids (water, hydrocarbons, geothermal fluids, etc.)
in deeper formations is also a concern of geologists, geophysicists and petroleum geologists.
Groundwater is a slow-moving, viscous fluid (with a Reynolds number less than unity); many of the empirically derived laws of groundwater flow can be alternately derived in fluid mechanics from the special case of Stokes flow (viscosity and pressure terms, but no inertial term).
The mathematical relationships used to describe the flow of water through porous media are the diffusion and Laplace equations, which have applications in many diverse fields.
Steady groundwater flow (Laplace equation) has been simulated using electrical, elastic and heat conduction analogies.
Transient groundwater flow is analogous to the diffusion of heat in a solid, therefore some solutions to hydrological problems have been adapted from heat transfer literature.
Traditionally, the movement of groundwater has been studied separately from surface water, climatology, and even the chemical and microbiological aspects of hydrogeology (the processes are uncoupled).
As the field of hydrogeology matures, the strong interactions between groundwater, surface water, water chemistry, soil moisture and even climate are becoming more clear.
For example: Aquifer drawdown or overdrafting and the pumping of fossil water may be a contributing factor to sea-level rise.
Some hypothetical, but characteristic questions asked would be:*Can the aquifer support another subdivision?
*Will the river dry up if the farmer doubles his irrigation?
*Did the chemicals from the dry cleaning facility travel through the aquifer to my well and make me sick?
*Will the plume of effluent leaving my neighbor's septic system flow to my drinking water well?
Most of these questions can be addressed through simulation of the hydrologic system (using numerical models or analytic equations).
Accurate simulation of the aquifer system requires knowledge of the aquifer properties and boundary conditions.
Therefore a common task of the hydrogeologist is determining aquifer properties using aquifer tests.
In order to further characterize aquifers and aquitards some primary and derived physical properties are introduced below.
Aquifers are broadly classified as being either confined or unconfined (water table aquifers), and either saturated or unsaturated; the type of aquifer affects what properties control the flow of water in that medium (e.g., the release of water from storage for confined aquifers is related to the storativity, while it is related to the specific yield for unconfined aquifers).
The head gradient is the change in hydraulic head per length of flowpath, and appears in Darcy's law as being proportional to the discharge.
Hydraulic head is a directly measurable property that can take on any value (because of the arbitrary datum involved in the "z" term); "ψ" can be measured with a pressure transducer (this value can be negative, e.g., suction, but is positive in saturated aquifers), and "z" can be measured relative to a surveyed datum (typically the top of the well casing).
Commonly, in wells tapping unconfined aquifers the water level in a well is used as a proxy for hydraulic head, assuming there is no vertical gradient of pressure.
A record of hydraulic head through time at a well is a hydrograph or, the changes in hydraulic head recorded during the pumping of a well in a test are called drawdown.
=== Porosity ===Porosity ("n") is a directly measurable aquifer property; it is a fraction between 0 and 1 indicating the amount of pore space between unconsolidated soil particles or within a fractured rock.
Typically, the majority of groundwater (and anything dissolved in it) moves through the porosity available to flow (sometimes called effective porosity).
Permeability is an expression of the connectedness of the pores.
An example of this phenomenon is pumice, which, when in its unfractured state, can make a poor aquifer.
Porosity does not directly affect the distribution of hydraulic head in an aquifer, but it has a very strong effect on the migration of dissolved contaminants, since it affects groundwater flow velocities through an inversely proportional relationship.
The water content is very important in vadose zone hydrology, where the hydraulic conductivity is a strongly nonlinear function of water content; this complicates the solution of the unsaturated groundwater flow equation.
These properties are measures of an aquifer's ability to transmit water.
=== Specific storage and specific yield ===Specific storage ("Ss") and its depth-integrated equivalent, storativity ("S=Ssb"), are indirect aquifer properties (they cannot be measured directly); they indicate the amount of groundwater released from storage due to a unit depressurization of a confined aquifer.
They are fractions between 0 and 1.
The value for specific yield is less than the value for porosity because some water will remain in the medium even after drainage due to intermolecular forces.
Often the porosity or effective porosity is used as an upper bound to the specific yield.
Besides needing to understand where the groundwater is flowing, based on the other hydrologic properties discussed above, there are additional aquifer properties which affect how dissolved contaminants move with groundwater.
This is the "microscopic" mechanism, on the scale of soil particles.
More important, on long distances, can be the macroscopic inhomogeneities of the aquifer, which can have regions of larger or smaller permeability, so that some water can find a preferential path in one direction, some other in a different direction, so that the contaminant can be spread in a completely irregular way, like in a (three-dimensional) delta of a river.
Dispersivity is actually a factor which represents our "lack of information" about the system we are simulating.
There are many small details about the aquifer which are being averaged when using a macroscopic approach (e.g., tiny beds of gravel and clay in sand aquifers), they manifest themselves as an "apparent" dispersivity.
Because of this, α is often claimed to be dependent on the length scale of the problem — the dispersivity found for transport through 1 m3 of aquifer is different from that for transport through 1 cm3 of the same aquifer material.
==== Molecular Diffusion ====Diffusion is a fundamental physical phenomenon, which Einstein characterized as Brownian motion, that describes the random thermal movement of molecules and small particles in gases and liquids.
It is an important phenomenon for small distances (it is essential for the achievement of thermodynamic equilibria), but, as the time necessary to cover a distance by diffusion is proportional to the square of the distance itself, it is ineffective for spreading a solute over macroscopic distances.
The diffusion coefficient, D, is typically quite small, and its effect can often be considered negligible (unless groundwater flow velocities are extremely low, as they are in clay aquitards).
It is important not to confuse diffusion with dispersion, as the former is a physical phenomenon and the latter is an empirical factor which is cast into a similar form as diffusion, because we already know how to solve that problem.
==== Retardation by adsorption ====The retardation factor is another very important feature that make the motion of the contaminant to deviate from the average groundwater motion.
It is analogous to the retardation factor of chromatography.
Unlike diffusion and dispersion, which simply spread the contaminant, the retardation factor changes its "global average velocity", so that it can be much slower than that of water.
This is due to a chemico-physical effect: the adsorption to the soil, which holds the contaminant back and does not allow it to progress until the quantity corresponding to the chemical adsorption equilibrium has been adsorbed.
This effect is particularly important for less soluble contaminants, which thus can move even hundreds or thousands times slower than water.
The effect of this phenomenon is that only more soluble species can cover long distances.
The retardation factor depends on the chemical nature of both the contaminant and the aquifer.
== Governing equations ===== Darcy's Law ===Darcy's law is a Constitutive equation (empirically derived by Henri Darcy, in 1856) that states the amount of groundwater discharging through a given portion of aquifer is proportional to the cross-sectional area of flow, the hydraulic head gradient, and the hydraulic conductivity.
=== Groundwater flow equation ===The groundwater flow equation, in its most general form, describes the movement of groundwater in a porous medium (aquifers and aquitards).
It is known in mathematics as the diffusion equation, and has many analogs in other fields.
Many solutions for groundwater flow problems were borrowed or adapted from existing heat transfer solutions.
It is often derived from a physical basis using Darcy's law and a conservation of mass for a small control volume.
The equation is often used to predict flow to wells, which have radial symmetry, so the flow equation is commonly solved in polar or cylindrical coordinates.
The Theis equation is one of the most commonly used and fundamental solutions to the groundwater flow equation; it can be used to predict the transient evolution of head due to the effects of pumping one or a number of pumping wells.
The Thiem equation is a solution to the steady state groundwater flow equation (Laplace's Equation) for flow to a well.
Unless there are large sources of water nearby (a river or lake), true steady-state is rarely achieved in reality.
Both above equations are used in aquifer tests (pump tests).
The Hooghoudt equation is a groundwater flow equation applied to subsurface drainage by pipes, tile drains or ditches.
An alternative subsurface drainage method is drainage by wells for which groundwater flow equations are also available.
== Calculation of groundwater flow ==To use the groundwater flow equation to estimate the distribution of hydraulic heads,or the direction and rate of groundwater flow, this partial differential equation (PDE) must be solved.
The most common means of analytically solving the diffusion equation in the hydrogeology literature are:* Laplace, Hankel and Fourier transforms (to reduce the number of dimensions of the PDE),* similarity transform (also called the Boltzmann transform) is commonly how the Theis solution is derived,* separation of variables, which is more useful for non-Cartesian coordinates, and* Green's functions, which is another common method for deriving the Theis solution — from the fundamental solution to the diffusion equation in free space.
No matter which method we use to solve the groundwater flow equation, we need both initial conditions(heads at time ("t") = 0) and boundary conditions (representing either the physicalboundaries of the domain, or an approximation of the domain beyond thatpoint).
Often the initial conditions are supplied to a transientsimulation, by a corresponding steady-state simulation (where the timederivative in the groundwater flow equation is set equal to 0).
There are two broad categories of how the (PDE) would be solved; eitheranalytical methods, numerical methods, or something possibly in between.
Typically, analytic methods solve the groundwater flow equation under a simplified set of conditions "exactly", while numerical methods solve it under more general conditions to an "approximation".
=== Analytic methods ===Analytic methods typically use the structure of mathematics to arrive at a simple, elegant solution, but the required derivation for all but the simplest domain geometries can be quite complex (involving non-standard coordinates, conformal mapping, etc.).
Analytic solutions typically are also simply an equation that can give a quick answer based on a few basic parameters.
The Theis equation is a very simple (yet still very useful) analytic solution to the groundwater flow equation, typically used to analyze the results of an aquifer test or slug test.
Numerical methods have been around much longer than computers have (In the 1920s Richardson developed some of the finite difference schemes still in use today, but they were calculated by hand, using paper and pencil, by human "calculators"), but they have become very important through the availability of fast and cheap personal computers.
A quick survey of the main numerical methods used in hydrogeology, and some of the most basic principles are shown below and further discussed in the Groundwater model article.
There are two broad categories of numerical methods: gridded or discretized methods and non-gridded or mesh-free methods.
In the common finite difference method and finite element method (FEM) the domain is completely gridded ("cut" into a grid or mesh of small elements).
The analytic element method (AEM) and the boundary integral equation method (BIEM — sometimes also called BEM, or Boundary Element Method) are only discretized at boundaries or along flow elements (line sinks, area sources, etc.
), the majority of the domain is mesh-free.
====General properties of gridded methods====Gridded Methods like finite difference and finite element methods solve the groundwater flow equation by breaking the problem area (domain) into many small elements (squares, rectangles, triangles, blocks, tetrahedra, etc.)
and solving the flow equation for each element (all material properties are assumed constant or possibly linearly variable within an element), then linking together all the elements using conservation of mass across the boundaries between the elements (similar to the divergence theorem).
This results in a system which overall approximates the groundwater flow equation, but exactly matches the boundary conditions (the head or flux is specified in the elements which intersect the boundaries).
For example the first-order time derivative is often approximated using the following forward finite difference, where the subscripts indicate a discrete time location,: formula_1The forward finite difference approximation is unconditionally stable, but leads to an implicit set of equations (that must be solved using matrix methods, e.g.
LU or Cholesky decomposition).
The similar backwards difference is only conditionally stable, but it is explicit and can be used to "march" forward in the time direction, solving one grid node at a time (or possibly in parallel, since one node depends only on its immediate neighbors).
Rather than the finite difference method, sometimes the Galerkin FEM approximation is used in space (this is different from the type of FEM often used in structural engineering) with finite differences still used in time.
It is developed by the US Geological Survey as a modular and extensible simulation tool for modeling groundwater flow.
It is free software developed, documented and distributed by the USGS.
Many commercial products have grown up around it, providing graphical user interfaces to its input file based interface, and typically incorporating pre- and post-processing of user data.
Many other models have been developed to work with MODFLOW input and output, making linked models which simulate several hydrologic processes possible (flow and transport models, surface water and groundwater models and chemical reaction models), because of the simple, well documented nature of MODFLOW.
====Application of finite element models====Finite Element programs are more flexible in design (triangular elements vs. the block elements most finite difference models use) and there are some programs available (SUTRA, a 2D or 3D density-dependent flow model by the USGS; Hydrus, a commercial unsaturated flow model; FEFLOW, a commercial modelling environment for subsurface flow, solute and heat transport processes; OpenGeoSys, a scientific open-source project for thermo-hydro-mechanical-chemical (THMC) processes in porous and fractured media;, COMSOL Multiphysics (FEMLAB) a commercial general modelling environment), and Integrated Water Flow Model (IWFM), but they are still not as popular in with practicing hydrogeologists as MODFLOW is.
Finite element models are more popular in university and laboratory environments, where specialized models solve non-standard forms of the flow equation (unsaturated flow, density dependent flow, coupled heat and groundwater flow, etc.)
====Application of finite volume models====The finite volume method is a method for representing and evaluating partial differential equations as algebraic equations 2002; Toro, 1999.
Similar to the finite difference method, values are calculated at discrete places on a meshed geometry.
In the finite volume method, volume integrals in a partial differential equation that contain a divergence term are converted to surface integrals, using the divergence theorem.
These terms are then evaluated as fluxes at the surfaces of each finite volume.
Because the flux entering a given volume is identical to that leaving the adjacent volume, these methods are conservative.
Another advantage of the finite volume method is that it is easily formulated to allow for unstructured meshes.
The method is used in many computational fluid dynamics packages.
PORFLOW software package is a comprehensive mathematical model for simulation of Ground Water Flow and Nuclear Waste Management developed by Analytic & Computational Research, Inc., ACRi]ACRiThe FEHM software package is available free from Los Alamos National Laboratory and can be accessed at the FEHM Website.
This versatile porous flow simulator includes capabilities to model multiphase, thermal, stress, and multicomponent reactive chemistry.
Current work using this code includes simulation of methane hydrate formation, CO2 sequestration, oil shale extraction, migration of both nuclear and chemical contaminants, environmental isotope migration in the unsaturated zone, and karst formation.
====Other methods====These include mesh-free methods like the Analytic Element Method (AEM) and the Boundary Element Method (BEM), which are closer to analytic solutions, but they do approximate the groundwater flow equation in some way.
The BEM and AEM exactly solve the groundwater flow equation (perfect mass balance), while approximating the boundary conditions.
These methods are more exact and can be much more elegant solutions (like analytic methods are), but have not seen as widespread use outside academic and research groups yet.

This equation has important applications in the science of optics, where it provides solutions that describe the propagation of electromagnetic waves (light) in the form of either paraboloidal waves or Gaussian beams.
Most lasers emit beams that take this form.
In the paraxial approximation, the complex amplitude of the electric field "E" becomes:formula_32where "A" represents the complex-valued amplitude of the electric field, which modulates the sinusoidal plane wave represented by the exponential factor.
The paraxial approximation places certain upper limits on the variation of the amplitude function "A" with respect to longitudinal distance "z".

Many sayings about "atemi" are attributed to Morihei Ueshiba, who considered them an essential element of technique.
Strategic choice of techniques, based on how they reposition the student relative to other attackers, is important in "randori" training.
For instance, an "ura" technique might be used to neutralise the current attacker while turning to face attackers approaching from behind.
In Shodokan Aikido, "randori" differs in that it is not performed with multiple persons with defined roles of defender and attacker, but between two people, where both participants attack, defend, and counter at will.

In 1977, the 1977 Soviet Constitution changed the term "national okrugs" to "autonomous okrugs" in order to emphasize that they were indeed autonomies and not simply another type of administrative and territorial division.
