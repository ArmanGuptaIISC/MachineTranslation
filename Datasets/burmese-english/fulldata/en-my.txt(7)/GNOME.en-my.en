Unable to open swap file. GIMP has run out of memory and cannot use the swap file. Some parts of your images may be corrupted. Try to save your work using different filenames, restart GIMP and check the location of the swap directory in your Preferences.
Failed to resize swap file: %s
Could not open '%s' for writing: %s
Error writing '%s': %s
Error reading '%s': %s
There was an error parsing your '%s' file. Default values will be used. A backup of your configuration has been created at '%s'.
When enabled, an image will become the active image when its image window receives the focus. This is useful for window managers using "click to focus".
Sets the canvas padding color used if the padding mode is set to custom color.
Specifies how the area around the image should be drawn.
How to handle embedded color profiles when opening a file.
Ask for confirmation before closing an image without saving.
Sets the pixel format to use for mouse pointers.
Sets the type of mouse pointers to use.
Context-dependent mouse pointers are helpful. They are enabled by default. However, they require overhead that you may want to do without.
When enabled, this will ensure that each pixel of an image gets mapped to a pixel on the screen.
This is the distance in pixels where Guide and Grid snapping activates.
Tools such as fuzzy-select and bucket fill find regions based on a seed-fill algorithm. The seed fill starts at the initially selected pixel and progresses in all directions until the difference of pixel intensity from the original is greater than a specified threshold. This value represents the default threshold.
The window type hint that is set on dock windows. This may affect the way your window manager decorates and handles dock windows.
When enabled, the selected brush will be used for all tools.
When enabled, the selected gradient will be used for all tools.
When enabled, the selected pattern will be used for all tools.
Sets the browser used by the help system.
Sets the text to appear in image window status bars.
Sets the text to appear in image window titles.
When enabled, this will ensure that the full image is visible after a file is opened, otherwise it will be displayed with a scale of 1:1.
Install a private colormap; might be useful on 8-bit (256 colors) displays.
Sets the level of interpolation used for scaling and other transformations.
How many recently opened image filenames to keep on the File menu.
Speed of marching ants in the selection outline. This value is in milliseconds (less time indicates faster marching).
GIMP will warn the user if an attempt is made to create an image that would take more memory than the size specified here.
When enabled, GIMP will show mnemonics in menus.
Generally only a concern for 8-bit displays, this sets the minimum number of system colors allocated for GIMP.
Sets the monitor's horizontal resolution, in dots per inch. If set to 0, forces the X server to be queried for both horizontal and vertical resolution information.
Sets the monitor's vertical resolution, in dots per inch. If set to 0, forces the X server to be queried for both horizontal and vertical resolution information.
If enabled, the move tool sets the edited layer or path as active. This used to be the default behaviour in older versions.
Sets the size of the navigation preview available in the lower right corner of the image window.
Sets how many processors GIMP should try to use simultaneously.
When enabled, the X server is queried for the mouse's current position on each motion event, rather than relying on the position hint. This means painting with large brushes should be more accurate, but it may be slower. Perversely, on some X servers enabling this option results in faster painting.
Sets whether GIMP should create previews of layers and channels. Previews in the layers and channels dialog are nice to have but they can slow things down when working with large images.
Sets the preview size used for layers and channel previews in newly created dialogs.
When enabled, the image window will automatically resize itself whenever the physical image size changes.
When enabled, the image window will automatically resize itself when zooming into and out of images.
Let GIMP try to restore your last saved session on each startup.
Remember the current tool, pattern, color, and brush across GIMP sessions.
Keep a permanent record of all opened and saved files in the Recent Documents list.
Save the positions and sizes of the main dialogs when GIMP exits.
Save the tool options when GIMP exits.
When enabled, all paint tools will show a preview of the current brush's outline.
When enabled, dialogs will show a help button that gives access to the related help page. Without this button, the help page can still be reached by pressing F1.
When enabled, the mouse pointer will be shown over the image while using a paint tool.
When enabled, the menubar is visible by default. This can also be toggled with the "View->Show Menubar" command.
When enabled, the rulers are visible by default. This can also be toggled with the "View->Show Rulers" command.
When enabled, the scrollbars are visible by default. This can also be toggled with the "View->Show Scrollbars" command.
When enabled, the statusbar is visible by default. This can also be toggled with the "View->Show Statusbar" command.
When enabled, the selection is visible by default. This can also be toggled with the "View->Show Selection" command.
When enabled, the layer boundary is visible by default. This can also be toggled with the "View->Show Layer Boundary" command.
When enabled, the guides are visible by default. This can also be toggled with the "View->Show Guides" command.
When enabled, the grid is visible by default. This can also be toggled with the "View->Show Grid" command.
When enabled, the sample points are visible by default. This can also be toggled with the "View->Show Sample Points" command.
Show a tooltip when the pointer hovers over an item.
What to do when the space bar is pressed in the image window.
Sets the swap file location. GIMP uses a tile based memory allocation scheme. The swap file is used to quickly and easily swap tiles out to disk and back in. Be aware that the swap file can easily get very large if GIMP is used with large images. Also, things can get horribly slow if the swap file is created on a folder that is mounted over NFS. For these reasons, it may be desirable to put your swap file in "/tmp".
When enabled, menus can be torn off.
When enabled, dock windows (the toolbox and palettes) are set to be transient to the active image window. Most window managers will keep the dock windows above the image window then, but it may also have other effects.
When enabled, you can change keyboard shortcuts for menu items by hitting a key combination while the menu item is highlighted.
Save changed keyboard shortcuts when GIMP exits.
Restore saved keyboard shortcuts on each GIMP startup.
Sets the folder for temporary storage. Files will appear here during the course of running GIMP. Most files will disappear when GIMP exits, but some files are likely to remain, so it is best if this folder not be one that is shared by other users.
Sets the size of the thumbnail shown in the Open dialog.
The thumbnail in the Open dialog will be automatically updated if the file being previewed is smaller than the size set here.
When the amount of pixel data exceeds this limit, GIMP will start to swap tiles to disk. This is a lot slower but it makes it possible to work on images that wouldn't fit into memory otherwise. If you have a lot of RAM, you may want to set this to a higher value.
Show the current foreground and background colors in the toolbox.
Show the currently selected brush, pattern and gradient in the toolbox.
Show the currently active image in the toolbox.
The window type hint that is set on the toolbox. This may affect how your window manager decorates and handles the toolbox window.
Sets the manner in which transparency is displayed in images.
Sets the size of the checkerboard used to display transparency.
When enabled, GIMP will not save an image if it has not been changed since it was opened.
Sets the minimal number of operations that can be undone. More undo levels are kept available until the undo-size limit is reached.
Sets an upper limit to the memory that is used per image to keep operations on the undo stack. Regardless of this setting, at least as many undo-levels as configured can be undone.
Sets the size of the previews in the Undo History.
When enabled, pressing F1 will open the help browser.
Sets the external web browser to be used. This can be an absolute path or the name of an executable to search for in the user's PATH. If the command contains '%s' it will be replaced with the URL, else the URL will be appended to the command with a space separating the two.
