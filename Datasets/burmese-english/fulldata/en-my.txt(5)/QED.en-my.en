We're asked to multiply 65 times 1. So literally, we just need to multiply 65, and we could write it as a times sign like that or we could write it as a dot like that but this means 65 times 1. And there's two ways to interpret this.
As we begin our journey into the world of economics, I thought I would begin with a quote from one of the most famous economists of all time, the Scottish philosopher Adam Smith. And he really is kind of the first real economist in the way that we view it now.
So welcome to the Lean Launchpad class. If you're interested in the logistics on how to take this class, this lecture zero will describe it. But if you want to just get started, click on lecture one.
We're told to factor r squared plus 4r, minus 45. And there are simpler ways to factor this, because this has 1 as a leading coefficient on the r squared right here, but what we're going to do is we're going to factor this by grouping. And when you factor it by grouping, what you want to do is find two numbers whose product-- so the two numbers are a and b-- whose product is equal to the coefficient on r squared, 1 times negative 45, which is just negative 45.
So let's look at all of the different combinations that goes to negative 45, and see if when you add them, you ever get to 4. So let's take the combinations. Let's look at their different a's and b's, and let's see what happens when you sum them.
So I could try 1 and negative 45, but if you take their sum, that's not going to get you anywhere close to 4, even if you swapped them, negative 1 and positive 45. Let's see, if you do 3 and 15, 3 and negative 15, or negative 3 and 15, those are way more than 4 apart.
We're going to have to find numbers that are closer together. So let's see, 3, 4, 5 and 9, that looks interesting. 5 and 9 are 4 apart.
And the second group right here, has a common factor of negative 5.
So let's factor it out.
Negative 5r divided by negative 5 is just an r.
Negative 45 divided by negative 5 is a 9. And then we have an r plus 9 in both terms. r times r plus 9, negative 5 times r plus 9. So we can factor that out.
And then negative 5 times r plus 9, divided by r plus 9 is negative 5, and we're done!

Human beings have always observed that is you have an object that is moving, so this is a moving object, traveling to the right here, that it seems to stop on it's own. That if you do nothing to this moving object, on it's own, this object is going to come to a stop. It is going to come to rest.
you have to apply some type of a net force to it. And once again, this is completly consistent with everyday human experience, this is what we've all experienced our entire lives. But then these gentlemen show up in the 1600s, and you might be surprised to see three gentlemen here, because this is about Newton's first law of motion.
So the completly opposite way of thinking. For over 2000 years, objects tend to stop on their own, if you want to keep the movement, apply a force. These guys say,
Many thanks to Sal! :)
In the last few videos we wrote a nice little program here that asks the user for some type of input and then computes the factorial of that number and then prints it out. And thats nice, but you could imagine a world where you would want to calculate the factorial in multiple places or in multiple different programs or in the same program you want to calculate the factorial multiple times. And you don't want to write this code over and over again every time you want to calculate the factorial.
The keyword in Python for defining a function is "def". So I'm going to define a function, I'm going to call it the factorial function.
Sometimes beginning programmers have a habit of naming things like "x245" and someone who comes in later will have no clue what variable or that function is all about. So you definitely somehow name it so it gives an idea what is supposed to do. My function is called factorial and the user when they call factorial, they need to tell factorial what number I'm going to take the factorial of.
So returns the factorial of the argument "number". And sometimes you will hear the word parameter and sometimes you'll hear the word argument. When you are making a definition of a function, this is more formally called a parameter.
"Number" is one of the parameters to the factorial function. The actual number that someone else passes to it, so let's say someone calls factorial with a "3" here, then more formally that 3 would be the argument. So returns the factorial of the argument "number".
And then with the same logic we did before, "for i in range(number)", now we are not getting the number using the input function it is just being passed to the function, then "product" is equal to "product" x ("i"+1). Same logic as we had before.
So after you go through this for-loop, after you go through it, you are essentially going to go through it "number" times. "Product" will have in it the factorial of "number". And instead of outputting it directly, what we wanna do is return, we are going to return it to the calling program and in the next video I'm going to diagram this out a little bit cleaner if this seems a little bit confusing to you.
You define "product" is equal to 1 and then you go "number" times.
So "for i in range(number)", we have explained the logic of that in the previous video.
Everytime you start with 1, then you do 1 x 1 is going to be 1, then "product" is going to be 1 but then "i" is going to be 1. "i" starts off at zero, so it is going to be 1 x (0 + 1) gives you 1, then "i" is 2, so it's going to be 1 x 1, sorry, then "i" is 1 it is going to be 1 x (1 + 1), which is 1 x 2, so it is going to be 2 then and it will incrementing that way and we explained it in detail in the last video. And then finally it is going to return that "product". So if we want to have the same exact behavior as before but now we are using this function.
What we could do is, we could say, we still have the input, so this is our function definition but then along our main program, we have defined our function and now we could just say: "Look, from the user get a non-negative integer to take the factorial of"
And let's put that into, lets call that a variable called "user_input".
And then what I'm going to do is I'm going to define another variable to called "factorialofuser_input" and now this is going to be interesting. I'm going to call this function up here, so this is going to be equal to factorial of whatever the user had input. So the factorial of "user_input", the factorial of this variable right over here.
The factorial of user input. So now "factorialofuser_input" will be storing, I guess we should say, it would be pointing to the actual answer and now we just have to print it out.
So at least nothing broke so far, so once again, so I want to be clear the program started here but up here all we did is defined this so it is not creating any interaction with the user, it is actually not processing anything just yet, so it just defines this function then it goes down here and says: "Okay, get some input form the user" and thats what we are doing right here. After we input some number here, then it's gonna actually call this function with that number that we put, the number that we put, is gonna go put in the "user_input" and then it is gonna call factorial with "user_input" as an argument.
So let's try with the number 3. And it did not work! Oh, and I see why it did not work because I had this leftover from the previous program which actually makes no sense now.
Then you could just replace this later on and then any program that calls it, as long as it still works, it will work for that program and it will just work that much better.
Hello everyone, my name is Thomas Suarez. I've always had a fascination for computers and technology, and I made a few apps for the iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad. I'd like to share a couple with you today.
My favorite and most successful app is Bustin Jieber - (Laughter) - which is a Justin Bieber Whac-A-Mole. I created it because a lot of people at school disliked Justin Bieber a little bit, so I decided to make the app. So I went to work programming it, and I released it just before the holidays in 2010.
First of all, I've been programming in multiple other programming languages to get the basics down, such as Python, C, Java, etc. And then Apple released the iPhone, and with it, the iPhone software development kit, and the software development kit is a suite of tools for creating and programming an iPhone app. This opened up a whole new world of possibilities for me, and after playing with the software development kit a little bit,
I've gotten a lot of inspiration from Steve Jobs, and I've started an app club at school, and a teacher at my school is kindly sponsoring my app club. Any student at my school can come and learn how to design an app. This is so I can share my experiences with others.
So - (Laughter) - sorry - (Laughter) - so this is a resource to teachers, and educators should recognize this resource and make good use of it. I'd like to finish up by saying what I'd like to do in the future. First of all, I'd like to create more apps, more games.
I think now might be a good time to address another question that is probably circulating in your head-- and that is, what happened to the gold? Remember when we started this reserve bank, all of these national banks or whatever we want to call them, they had gold as a reserve. And then at some point, they said, well, why are we each holding gold?
In case X percentage of people wanted their gold back. So they would come back to the central bank and say, give us our gold. But the gold fundamentally-- it had no other function.
In order to increase the money supply with GDP because people are inventing computers and railroads and cars and highways are being built and we're all becoming more efficient-- in order to keep the money supply up with that extra economic activity, if we stay on the gold standard and if we want to keep these ratios between the money and gold, we'd have to grow our gold with the economy. And that's kind of arbitrary. Maybe we'd find a big bunch of gold or maybe we'd find no gold-- and that really should have no bearing on our technological progress and how hard we're working.
The U.S. government-- what are they good for? They're a bunch of crooks. They lie, cheat, and steal.
It's backed by people's trust in the ability of the U.S. economy to support debt to pay off the value of this currency. We'll talk more about that in the future. I don't want to get too circular in my conversations.
I'd like to talk about my dad. My dad has Alzheimer's disease. He started showing the symptoms about 12 years ago, and he was officially diagnosed in 2005.
(Applause) Hi. My name is Cameron Russell.
And I always just say, "Oh, I was scouted". But that means nothing. The real way that I became a model is I won a genetic lottery, and I am the recipient of a legacy.
Naomi, Tyra, Joan Smalls, Liu Wen
And first I commend your model knowledge, very impressive [Laughter] But unfortunately, I have to inform you that in 2007 A very inspired NYU PHD student counted all the models on the runway
"No no Cameron, I want to be a model" Well then I say, "Be my boss" Because I'm not in charge of anything
And when we're back stage we give an answer that maybe makes it seem like that We say it's really amazing to travel And it's amazing to get to work with creative inspired passionate people
And I think that it's great I got to come You know, before ten or twenty or thirty years had passed And I'd had more agency in my career
Um, if there's a take away to this talk I hope it's that we all feel more comfortable acknowledging the power of image
In our perceived successes and our perceived failures Thank you [Applause]
We need to calculate 9.005 minus 3.6, or we could view it as 9 and 5 thousandths minus 3 and 6 tenths. Whenever you do a subtracting decimals problem, the most important thing, and this is true when you're adding decimals as well, is you have to line up the decimals. So this is 9.005 minus 3.6.
I had a fire nine days ago. My archive: 175 films, my 16-millimeter negative, all my books, my dad's books, my photographs.
"King, Murray" won Cannes Film Festival 1970 -- the only print I had. That's my papers. That was in minutes -- 20 minutes.
"You've got to make something good out of something bad," I started to say to my friends, neighbors, my sister. By the way, that's "Sputnik." I ran it last year.
"Sputnik" was downtown, the negative. It wasn't touched.
These are some pieces of things I used in my Sputnik feature film, which opens in New York in two weeks downtown.
I called my sister. I called my neighbors. I said, "Come dig."
She came. She's a nurse in San Francisco.
"Dig it up," I said. "Pieces. I want pieces.
"I'm going to make something out of it, and maybe next year ... " And I appreciate this moment to come up on this stage with so many people who've already given me so much solace, and just say to TEDsters: I'm proud of me.
 Add and simplify the answer and write as a mixed number. So we have two mixed numbers here.

Welcome back. Now that we hopefully have a little bit of an intuition of what a limit is, or finding the limit of a function is, let's do some problems.
So let's say what is the limit-- once again, my pen is not working. What is the limit as x approaches-- let's say negative 1.
And let me see, what's a good-- let's say my expression is-- I'll put it in parentheses so it's cleaner. It's 2x plus 2 over x plus 1.
So here's a case, just like what we saw in that first video, where the limit actually can't equal what the expression equals when you substitute x for the number you're trying to find the limit of because you get an undefined answer.
So let's see if, using the limit, we can come up with a better answer for what it's approaching. Well, since we're just starting with these limit problems, let me draw a graph.
So you'll see, and I'll make sure you see it visually here, that the limit as approaches negative 1 of 2x plus 2 over x plus 1, it equals 2. Let me draw a line here so you don't get messed up with all of it.
And I'm not formally, I guess, proving here that the limit is 2, but I'm showing you kind of an analytical way, and this is actually how it tends to be done in algebra class, is that you tend to simplify the expression so that you say, oh, if there wasn't a hole here, what would the f of x equal, right? And then you'd just evaluate it at that point. I think this might give you a little intuition, but this isn't a formal solution.
A line has a slop of negatave 3/4ths, and goes through the point (0,8). What is the equation of this line in slope-intercept form? So any line can be represented in slope-intercept form as y=mx+b.
We're told that Jared is twice the age of his brother, Peter.
So, Jared is twice the age of his brother, Peter. Peter is four years old.
Peter is four years old, and Jared is twice the age of his brother, Peter. So, Jared is twice Peter's age of four. And then they tell us Talia's age is 3 times Jared's age.
Jared is twice the age of his brother, Peter. So Jared-Let me do that in yellow-So Jared- That's not yellow. Jared- Jared is twice the age of his brother.
And then finally they say Talia's age- let me write Talia's- Talia right over here. Talia's age and they say it- they tell it to us right over here.
It's three times Jared's age. So Talia's age is three times Jared's age. Well we were able to figure out Jared's age. it is eight.
It is three times Jared's age. If you know your multiplication tables this should maybe jump out at you. And your multiplication tables really are one of those things in mathmatics
I have this rectangle here and I want to figure out its area. I want to figure out how much space it is taking up on my screen, right over here. And I encourage you to pause this video and try to figure out the area of this entire rectangle.
 Find the greatest common factor of these monomials. And when they say monomials, that's just a fancy word for saying a one term expression.
like cd squared, break it up into the product of the most simple variable, for example, c times d times d. So let's do that for each of them and see what the greatest common factor is. Where do these overlap in terms of their factor?
10 cd squared, what is that equal to? Well 10 is equal to 2 times 5. You could do a factoring tree here, but these are pretty straightforward numbers to factor into.
So 10 is 2 times 5, c, all you can do is break that, you could just write that as a c, you can't really simplify that anymore.
And d squared can be written as d times d.
So I have essentially broken 10cd squared into this, into the product of kind of the smallest constituents that I could think of. The prime factors of 10, and then c, and then d. Now let's do 5cd.
In fact you can't have a greater number than 5cd be a common factor, because the largest factor of 5cd is 5cd. So the greatest common factor of these three monomials, or these three expressions, is 5cd.
The largest number of factors that overlaps with all three of these expressions is a 5, one c, and one d.
We are asked to simplify a log base 5 of 25 to the "x" power over "y" So I will give you some logarithm properties and I do agree that this does require some simplification over here
That this having this right over here inside of the logarithm is not a pleasant way to look at it So the first thing that we realize is that this is one of our logarithm properties So logarithm for a given base so lets say that the base is "x" of a/b
Log base 5 twenty five to the "x" over "y" to this property means that its the same thing as log base 5 to the twenty five to the "x" power minus log base 5 of "y"
Now this looks like we can do a little bit of simplifying It seems like the relevant logarithm property here is if I have log base "x" of a to the "p" power That's the same thing as b times log base "x" of a
What I thought I would do is I would start with a simple request. I'd like all of you to pause for a moment, you wretched weaklings, and take stock of your miserable existence. (Laughter)
Now that was the advice that St. Benedict gave his rather startled followers in the fifth century. It was the advice that I decided to follow myself when I turned 40. Up until that moment, I had been that classic corporate warrior --
It's particularly important -- this isn't on the World Wide Web, is it? I'm about to get fired -- it's particularly important that you never put the quality of your life in the hands of a commercial corporation. Now I'm not talking here just about the bad companies -- the "abattoirs of the human soul," as I call them.
We need to elongate the time frame upon which we judge the balance in our life, but we need to elongate it without falling into the trap of the "I'll have a life when I retire, when my kids have left home, when my wife has divorced me, my health is failing, I've got no mates or interests left." (Laughter)
My wife, who is somewhere in the audience today, called me up at the office and said, "Nigel, you need to pick our youngest son" -- Harry -- "up from school." Because she had to be somewhere else with the other three children for that evening.
So I left work an hour early that afternoon and picked Harry up at the school gates. We walked down to the local park, messed around on the swings, played some silly games. I then walked him up the hill to the local cafe, and we shared a pizza for two, then walked down the hill to our home, and I gave him his bath and put him in his Batman pajamas.
I then read him a chapter of Roald Dahl's "James and the Giant Peach." I then put him to bed, tucked him in, gave him a kiss on his forehead and said, "Goodnight, mate," and walked out of his bedroom.
As I was walking out of his bedroom, he said, "Dad?" I went, "Yes, mate?" He went, "Dad, this has been the best day of my life, ever." I hadn't done anything, hadn't taken him to Disney World or bought him a Playstation.
Several years ago here at TED, Peter Skillman introduced a design challenge called the marshmallow challenge. And the idea's pretty simple: Teams of four have to build the tallest free-standing structure out of 20 sticks of spaghetti, one yard of tape, one yard of string and a marshmallow.
And since then, I've conducted about 70 design workshops across the world with students and designers and architects, even the CTOs of the Fortune 50, and there's something about this exercise that reveals very deep lessons about the nature of collaboration, and I'd like to share some of them with you. So, normally, most people begin by orienting themselves to the task. They talk about it, they figure out what it's going to look like, they jockey for power.
As Peter tells us, not only do they produce the tallest structures, but they're the most interesting structures of them all. So the question you want to ask is: How come?
And Peter likes to say that none of the kids spend any time trying to be CEO of Spaghetti, Inc. Right? They don't spend time jockeying for power.
Now that we have a reasonable understanding of why austerity is very difficult. 1) There probably isn't the political will to do it. And even more, it might drive Greece into a bigger recession.
So that looks pretty good. So this is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. So if we want to take 2/3 of 6, we can think of this whole section of the number
Everything is interconnected.
As a Shinnecock Indian, I was raised to know this. We are a small fishing tribe situated on the southeastern tip of Long Island near the town of Southampton in New York.
When I was a little girl, my grandfather took me to sit outside in the sun on a hot summer day. There were no clouds in the sky. And after a while I began to perspire.
John: Hi, Iâm John Green. This is Crash Course World History and today weâre going to be discussing trade here in the Indian Ocean.
King Charles VI of France believed that he was made out of glass relentlessly focusing on the actions of the funny-hatted people who ruled us makes us forget that we also make history.
Mr. Green, Mr. Green! Did Charles VI of France really believe he was made out of glass? Yes, he did but today we're talking about Indian Ocean trade and it's going to be interesting, I promise.
So pay attention Also, no hats! This is a classroom not a Truman Capote beach party.
Just as the Silk Road was not a single road, there were lots of Indian Ocean trade routes connecting various port cities around the Indian Ocean Basin, including Zanzibar and Mogadishu and Hormuz and Canton. By the way, before you criticize my pronunciation, please remember that mispronunciation is my thing and I've been doing it since episode 1 and nobody ever notices it's a thing! Sorry, I lost it there.
Indian Ocean trade was bigger, richer and featured more diverse players than the Silk Road but it is much less famous probably because it does not have a snazzy name. What do you think, Stan?
Like the Neptunian Network? No.
The Wet Web? No, that's definitely not it. The Sexy Sea Lanes of South Asia?
No, that's too hard for me to say with my lisp. The Monsoon Marketplace. Thanks, Danica.
By about 700 CE, there was a recognizable Monsoon Marketplace but it really blew up between 1000 CE and 1200. It then declined a bit during the Pax Mongolica when overland trade became cheap and safe thanks to wait for it:
The Mongols. Then the Indian Ocean trade surged again in the 14th and 15th centuries.
So who was trading? Swahili Coast cities, Islamic empires in the Middle East, India, China, Southeast Asia and not Europe, which is probably one of the other reasons that Monsoon Marketplace isn't as famous as it should be.
Immediately after your second wedding you commit suicide by slicing open your belly and offer your intestines to your horrible new husband as a wedding present.
No Stan, I don't want to say it but I have to. That really took guts, Kota Rani. Sorry.
However, when it becomes cheaper thanks to trade suddenly more people can have better houses. Much of the timber that was shipped in the Monsoon Marketplace came from Africa which is kind of emblematic. Africa produced a lot of the raw materials
like animal hides and skin and ivory and gold. The Swahili city states imported finished goods such as silk and porcelain from China and cotton cloth from India. Spices and foodstuffs like rice were shipped from Southeast Asia and especially Sri Lanka where black pepper was a primary export and the Islamic world provided everything from coffee to books to weapons.
That's exactly what happened to such an extent that a powerful merchant state called Srivijaya rose up on Sumatra. For a while, Srivijaya dominated trade in the region because there were so many ships going through the Strait of Malacca to and from China.
But as we will see in another episode that this trade abruptly declined in the 15th century and with it so did Srivijaya. This brings up a key point about Indian Ocean trade which is that it was indispensable to the creation of certain city states like Srivijaya and the city states of the Swahili Coast.
If you were asked, what happened to you before you took your very first breath, would you know? Did you know that learning about the time from just before you were conceived until after you were born, could improve the quality of your life? What do you know about your earliest experiences?
Was your mother mourning the loss of a loved one? Was she the victim of domestic violence? Was it toxic perhaps?
During those moments I often wondered, if Sultan is this aware when he should have been inside his mother for at least another 2 months, could it be that babies inside the womb are just as aware of what goes on around them? After becoming a member of the Association for Pre and Perinatal Psychology, I discovered that everything I had begun to wonder was true.
What I found really interesting is when I talk to people about how the way we come into the world affects us, most people say, "It makes so much sense!" or, that they wished they would have known, because then they would have done things differently. During my life, I discovered that nothing ever goes away, until it teaches us what it is we need to know. It felt like the garments in my mother's closet had become the wardrobe of my life.
"I finally understand why had it been so difficult for me to find my voice and to express myself, unless I scream into a microphone on stage." I also found it heartbreaking when I learned that the tragic characteristics that Saddam Hussein and Hitler shared with almost 75% of death row inmates here in the United States, are an unwanted conception and an extremely difficult pre-natal period and early start in life. The majority of them also suffered multiple abandonments, mostly by their fathers.

 We're asked to look at the table below. From the information given, is there a functional relationship between each person and his or her height?
There are not two heights for Nathan. There is only one height. And for any one of these people that we can input into the function, there's only one height associated with them, so it is a functional relationship.
We have Joelle, we have Nathan, we have Stewart, we have LJ, and then we have Tariq right there. So lets plot them.
So you have Joelle, Joelle's height is 5-6, so 5-6 is right about there. Then you have Nathan. Let me do it in a different color.
Nathan's height is 4-11. We will plot to him right over there. Then you have Stewart.
Stewart's height is 5-11. He is pretty close to six feet.
So Stewart's height-- I made him like six feet; let me make it a little lower-- is 5-11. Then you have LJ.
LJ's height is 5-6. So you have two people with a height of 5-6, but that's OK, as long as for each person you only have one height. And then finally, Tariq is 6 foot 1.
Tariq is right up here at 6 foot 1. So notice, for any one of the inputs into our function, we only have one value, so this is a functional relationship. Now, you might say OK, well, isn't everything a functional relationship?
Stewart, we would have two different values. If we were to graph this, we have Stewart here at 5-11, and then all of a sudden, we would also have Stewart at 5-3. Now, this doesn't make a lot of sense, so we would plot it right over here.
In order for this to be a function, there can only be one value for this. You don't know in this situation when I add this, whether it's 5-3 or 5-11.
Now, this wasn't the case, so that isn't there and so we know that the height of Stewart is 5-11 and this is a functional relationship.
I think to some level, it might be confusing, because it's such a simple idea. Each of these values can only have one height associated with it. That's what makes it a function.
 Round 24,259 to the nearest hundred. You're going to find that doing these problems are pretty straightforward, but what I want to do is just think about what it means to round to the nearest hundred.
The main mast of a fishing boat is supported by a sturdy rope that extends from the top of the mast to the deck. If the mast is 20 feet tall and the rope attaches to the deck 15 feet away from the base of the mast, how long is the rope? So let's draw ourselves a boat and make sure we understand what the deck and the mast and all of that is.
And then the mast is the thing that holds up the sail. So let me draw ourselves a mast. And they say the mast is 20 feet tall.
And all that tells us is it the sum of the squares of the shorter sides of the triangle are going to be equal to the square of the longer side. And that longer side is call the hypotenuse.
And in all cases, the hypotenuse is the side opposite the 90 degree angle. It is always going to be the longest side of our right triangle. So we need to figure out the hypotenuse here.
So 15 squared plus 20 squared is going to be equal to r squared.
And what's 15 squared? It's 225. 20 squared is 400.
We're asked to subtract, simplify the answer and write as a mixed number. So we have two mixed numbers here, and like when you're adding mixed numbers, you can do it two ways. You can either turn both of these into improper fractions and then subtract, or you can subtract the whole number part and then the fraction part, so let's do it that way.
So we get 5 plus 5/8, and then we distribute the negative sign, minus 2 minus 1/5. And now we can rearrange it. Let me do it in orange... as 5 minus 2, that's the whole number parts, and then you have plus 5/8 minus 1/5.
A non-profit organization devoted to "ideas worth spreading"
A message from TED Curator Chris Anderson
Now, today you are part of a truly remarkable global phenomenon. Around the world, thousands of people have been gathering in meetings to experience the power of ideas. A surprising thing about today's meeting is that we here at TED have had almost nothing to do with it.

Simply 4 ('a' squared) b and this whole quantity is being raised to the third power Now here we'll just use the property if we have the product of things, let's say I have a times b and I'm raising that to some power n this is just going to be equal to a to the n times b to the n.

Graph a line that has a slope that is negative and greater than the slope of the blue line. So let's think for a second about what slope means. So if you use the word slope in your everyday life, you're really talking about how inclined something is,
Find the greatest common factor of these monomials. Now the greatest common factor of anything is the largest factor that's divisible into both -- if we're just talking about pure numbers: into both numbers, or in this case into both monomials. Now we have to be a little bit careful when we talk about 'greatest' in the context of algebraic expressions like this because it's 'greatest' from the point of view that it includes the most factors for each of these monomials, it's not necessarily the greatest possible number because maybe some of these variables can take on negative values; maybe they are taking on values less than one so if squared they actually become a smaller number but I think, without getting too much into the weeds there,
It will be equal to this five, times we only have one c in common, times - we have two d's in common. So this is equal to 5 times c times d-squared. So 5 c d-squared we can view as the greatest --
I'll put that in quotes, you know, depending on whether c is negative or positive - and d is greater than or less than zero. But this is the "greatest" common factor of these two monomials. It's devisable into both of them and it uses the most factors possible.
Contagious is a good word. Even in the times of H1N1, I like the word. Laughter is contagious.
So, I'd like to show you a little glimpse of what common practice looks like at Riverside. A little background: when my grade five was learning about child rights, they were made to roll incense sticks, agarbattis, for eight hours to experience what it means to be a child laborer. What you will see is their journey, and then their utter conviction that they could go out and change the world.
So, when Ragav experienced that he went from "teacher told me," to "I am doing it." And that's the "I Can" mindshift. And it is a process that can be energized and nurtured. But we had parents who said,
"Okay, making our children good human beings is all very well, but what about math and science and English? Show us the grades." And we did.
Riverside children were outperforming the top 10 schools in India in math, English and science. So, it worked. It was now time to take it outside Riverside.
So, on August 15th, Independence Day, 2007, the children of Riverside set out to infect Ahmedabad. Now it was not about Riverside school. It was about all children.
Since 2007 every other month the city closes down the busiest streets for traffic and converts it into a playground for children and childhood. Here was a city telling its child, "You can." A glimpse of infection in Ahmedabad.
KBS: And because of that, Ahmedabad is known as India's first child-friendly city.
Basically again reaffirming that when adults believe in children and say, "You can," then they will. Infection in India. This is in Rajasthan, a rural village.
First time, a rally and a street play in a rural school -- unheard of -- to tell their parents why literacy is important.
Look at what their parents says. Man: This program is wonderful.
KBS: An inner city school in Hyderabad. Girl:
70 years ago, it took one man to infect an entire nation with the power of "We can." So, today who is it going to take to spread the infection from 100,000 children to the 200 million children in India? Last I heard, the preamble still said, "We, the people of India," right?
[Thrun] So congratulations. You learned a lot about Bayes networks.
You learned about the graph structure of Bayes networks, you understood how this is a compact representation, you learned about conditional independence, and we talked a little bit about application of Bayes network to interesting reasoning problems.
But by all means this was a mostly theoretical unit of this class, and in future classes we will talk more about applications.
The instrument of Bayes networks is really essential to a number of problems. It really characterizes the sparse dependence that exists in many readable problems like in robotics and computer vision and filtering and diagnostics and so on.
I really hope you enjoyed this class, and I really hope you understood in depth how Bayes networks work.
 Determine the number of solutions to the quadratic equation, x squared plus 14x plus 49 is equal to 0. There's a bunch of ways we could do it.
So the quadratic formula tells us that if we have an equation of the form ax squared plus bx plus c is equal to 0, that the solutions are going to be-- or the solution if it exists is going to be-- negative b plus or minus the square root of b squared minus 4ac.
All of that over 2a. Now the reason why this can be 2 solutions is that we have a plus or minus here. If this b squared minus 4ac is a positive number-- so let's think about this a little bit.
So this is going to lead to two solutions. Now what happens if b squared minus 4ac is equal to 0? If this expression under the radical is equal to 0, you're just going to have the square root of 0.
Well if b squared minus 4ac is less than 0, this is going to be a negative number right here and you're going to have to take the square root of a negative number. And we know, from dealing with real numbers, you can't take the square root. There is no real number squared that becomes a negative number.
So in this situation there is no solutions, or no real-- when I say real I literally mean a real number-- no real solution. So let's think about it in the context of this equation right here. And just in case you're curious if whether this expression right here, b squared minus 4ac, has a name, it does.
It's called the discriminant. This is the discriminant. That's that part of the quadratic equation.
Let me do it over here. 14 times 14. 4 times 4 is 16.
So 49 times 4. 4 times 9 is 36. 4 times 4 is 16 plus 3 is 190-- or is 19, so you get 196.
So we're dealing with a situation where the discriminant is equal to 0. We only have one solution. And if you want, you could try to find that one solution.
Solve for y? We have 3y plus 7 is less than 2y and 4y plus 8 is greater than negative 48. So we have to find all the y's that meet both of these constraints.
Subtract 8 from both sides. The left hand side, we're just left with a 4y, cuz these guys cancel out. 4y is greater than negative 48 minus 8, so we're gonna go another 8 negative.
The game of poker--is this partially observable, stochastic, continuous, or adversarial?
Adjust the leading coefficient in vertex coordinates to make the blue parabola match the orange parabola. Now we've already seen how we can go about shifting these parabolas. If we subtract something from y, it actually shifts the parabola up by that amount.
This vertex right over here is at the point x equals negative 4. y equals negative 3.
And it's no coincidence those are the values that make x equals negative 4 makes this 0. And y equals negative 3 makes this 0. But these parabolas still don't match up.
Okay, it's great to be back at TED. Why don't I just start by firing away with the video?

Sergey Brin: Oh, sorry, I just got this message from a Nigerian prince. He needs help getting 10 million dollars.
looking down at my phone, that's one of the reasons behind this project, Project Glass. Because we ultimately questioned whether this is the ultimate future of how you want to connect to other people in your life, how you want to connect to information. Should it be by just walking around looking down?
But that was the vision behind Glass, and that's why we've created this form factor. Okay. And I don't want to go through all the things it does and whatnot, but I want to tell you a little bit more about the motivation behind what led to it.
And ironically, if you want to hear it better, you actually just cover your ear, which is kind of surprising, but that's how it works. My vision when we started Google 15 years ago was that eventually you wouldn't have to have a search query at all. You'd just have information come to you as you needed it.
Some 17 years ago, I became allergic to Delhi's air. My doctors told me that my lung capacity had gone down to 70 percent, and it was killing me.
With the help of IlT, TERl, and learnings from NASA, we discovered that there are three basic green plants, common green plants, with which we can grow all the fresh air we need indoors to keep us healthy. We've also found that you can reduce the fresh air requirements into the building, while maintaining industry indoor air-quality standards.

What I want to do in this video is show you that "for" loops aren't the only types of loops you would use, although they probably are the most common.
You could also use something like a "while" loop, and maybe the while loop might be more intuitive, at least maybe in the Python context -- you can pick. So I'm going to write the same program. It's going to do the exact same thing, but instead of using a "for" loop I'm going to use a "while" loop.
So the "while" loop isn't going to automatically define what my "i" values are, and it's not going to automatically change my "i" values or me. I'm going to have to do that for myself, and I want to do the exact same behavior. I'm going to leave my old code down here so you can compare it a little bit, but then I'll delete it because I don't want the same thing to be run twice.
So I'm going to set "i" equal to zero, and this is, in case you're curious, the last time in the for loop "i" is only a valid variable inside the loop. Now I'm defining it outside of the loop, so it's actually a global variable. I'm defining it at the highest level.
So I'm going to keep doing what's inside of the loop clause, and I'm going to do it while "i" is less than 10. Remember: we want to do it for "i" equals zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine: everything up to, but not including ten (zero through nine). So while "i" is less than ten, do what I'm going to put in this clause.
Once "i" is not less than ten, or essentially once "i" is equal to ten, don't do it anymore. So it's going to have this same behavior as this right over here, and what I'm going to do is I'm going to say, "'sum' is equal to 'sum' plus 'i'", and then I'm going to print sum.
I want you to really think about how both of these are equivalent things. "i" started at zero before I even entered into this loop, and then "sum" started at zero for either of these. So you say "sum" is equal to sum plus "i". Well, that's the same: "print 'sum'".
Actually, if I don't want to get rid of this code, if I want it there just for future reference, but I don't want the Python interpreter to run it, I could comment them out, and you comment things out by putting a little hash sign there. So a hash sign there literally says,
"Hey, interpreter, ignore all of this stuff." It could be useful if you have some code in there that you want to just not be interpreted for now, and maybe you want to save it for later, and it's also useful if you want to tell someone who's actually reading the code, if you want to tell a human being whose reading the code, what this code does. So for example, you could write a little comment here that says,
"This while loop calculates the sum of zero through nine," and you'd say, "including nine." So if someone were to come back later, instead of having them figure out what this says, they could read your comment and say,
"Okay, this part of the code right here calculates the sum of zero to nine," and I could say, "and places it ..." So when you put this hash tag, it essentially comments out that line. So if I want to go to another line I have put another hash tag there. "... and places it in the variable 'sum'."
So then people know, "Woah, I know what it's doing, and I know that when all is said and done, the sum will be placed in this variable called 'sum'."
Anyway, let's run this program. I want to show that it ignores these things. If you wrote this text without a hash tag, the computer, the interpreter, would say,
"What is all this? This isn't Python code," but this is useful for someone else reading, and they'll also ignore this down here. So let's... ...and then let's save it.
So these are the results that we got before (you might remember) : zero, one, three, six, ten, all the way up to 45. Now let's run this thing assuming that I haven't made any bugs ... ... and I get the exact same thing. So this "while" loop is doing the exact same thing.
One thing you'll hear or see referred to a lot is something called a flowchart either in computer science, so really when people talk about any type of algorithm or process. So what I thought I would do is for every program I write— is I'll do a simple flowchart. Maybe I won't do it for every one, but I'll start with some of the basic ones.
So we start, you can kind of view as we starting at this line above this assignment of the number where we actually ask for input from the user. And then, after that, we ask for input from the user. This line right here.
"product equals 1", product is equal to 1.
We enter into our for loop. And we start with— and what I'm going to do here is
I'm going to write it a little bit different than we wrote it over here— so we do is we start a— what we are doing is we are going to start our for loop essentially with an assignment where we assign— for loop is really a bunch of things happening at the same time.
It assigns i to the first number in the sequence or it tests whether it can assign i to the first number in the sequence. If it can, then it proceeds.
If it can't, then it breaks out of the for loop. So let me put it this way. I will do kind of a test case right over here.
So if there are items left in the sequence. So we'll just say
"i is equal to next item" i is equal to next... i is euqal to the next item.
If there are— well, i'll just hold off for the case where there are no items left in the sequence— but let's say that there are. "i is equal to the next item"
And then we also define— we define product to be we define product actually I want to do these in blue just our regular... Se let me write this is "YES".
If there are items in the sequence, then "i is equal to the next item" that's one operation we do.
And then we reset product— we reassign product to be equal to what the former value of the product was times i + 1. And at this point, we essentially— we loop back to this test over here. So at this point, we loop back—
Because after you perform this operation— this is embedded in the loop— you go back to the beginning to see if there is any more of the loop to do.
So you go back to the beginning before the loop and you say "Hey, are there any items in the sequence?" and this should be a question mark over here.
This kind of question mark decision points are usually specified with this diamond.
If there is another item in the sequence then i is equal to the next item and product is equal to what product was times i + 1.
"Are there items left in the sequence?" And at some point there won't be any items left in the sequence. So there won't be— at some point there won't be any items left in the sequence.
We've boken out of this for loop.
And then, the next thing we do once we're done with our for loop is we just print the value of product. We just output the value of product. So that is an interaction with the user.
"output product" and we are done! And I can write "end" for the end of our program, and the program will stop running. "end".
So this is just a simple flowchart for this simple program. And hopefully it helps you appreciate that one little understanding of the program itself if the last two videos didn't help too much, and also gives you a simple understanding of how to write a flowchart.
Denis is vacationing in China and he wants to spend 30 dollars on a new sweater. The sweater he likes costs 197 Chinese yuan. One US dollar can be converted into 6 Chinese Juan.
Denis will have blank Chinese yuan if he converts his 30 US dollars. Let's think about this. He's going to take 30 dollars and the conversion rate is 6 yuan per dollar so he's going to have 30 dollars times 6 yuan per dollar, he's going to have 30 times 6 yuan.
Let's do a few more examples of finding the limit of functions as x approaches infinity or negative infinity. So here I have this crazy function, [reads function] So what's going to happen as x approaches infinity?
So for example, in the numerator, out of these three terms, the 9x^7 is going to grow much faster than any of these other terms, so this is the dominating term in the numerator, and in the denominator, 3x^7 is going to grow much faster than an x^5 term, and definitely much faster than a log base 2 term. So at infinity, as we get closer and closer to infinity, this function is going to be roughly equal to 9x^7 over 3x^7, and so we can say, especially since as we get larger and larger, as we get closer and closer to infinity, these two things are going to get closer and closer to each other, we can say this limit is going to be the same thing as this limit, which is going to be equal to the limit as x approaches infinity - well, we can just cancel out the x^7's, so it's going to be 9/3, or just 3, which is just going to be 3. So that is our limit as x approaches infinity of all of this craziness.
so this is going to be the same thing as the limit of 3x^3 over 6x^4 as x approaches negative infinity.
And if we simplify this, this is going to be equal to the limit as x approaches negative infinity of 1 over 2x. And what's this going to be? Well if the denominator, even though it's becoming a larger and larger negative number, it becomes one over a very, very large negative number, which is going to get us pretty darn close to zero, just as one over x as x approaches negative infinity gets us close to zero.
Factor 8k squared minus 24k minus 144. Now the first thing we can do here, just eyeballing each of these terms if we want to simplify it a good bit is all of these terms are divisible by 8. Clearly 8k squared is divisible by 8, 24 is divisible by 8, and 144, it might not be as obvious is divisble by 8, but it looks like it is.
So right here, we have a four-sided figure, or a quadrilateral, where two of the sides are parallel to each other. And so this, by definition, is a trapezoid. And what we want to do is, given the dimensions that they've given us, what is the area of this trapezoid.
So what do we get if we multiply 6 times 3? Well, that would be the area of a rectangle that is 6 units wide and 3 units high. So that would give us the area of a figure that
Use the commutative law of multiplication to write 2 times 34 in a different way. Simplify both expressions to show that they have identical results. So once again, this commutative law just means that order doesn't matter.
The goal in this video is to essentially prove a pretty simple result. And that's that the ratio between the volumes-- let me write this down-- that the ratio between the volume at state B and the volume at state A-- so the ratio of that volume to that volume-- is equal to, in our Carnot cycle, is equal to the ratio between the volume at state C. So this volume and that volume.
So our heat transfer in an adiabatic process is 0. So if we go back to our original definitions-- let me show you that here. Right here, at the step and this step, we have no transfer of heat.
Adiabatic-- we're completely isolated from the rest of the world. So there's nothing to transfer heat to or from. So if we go to our definition, almost, or our first law of thermodynamics, we know that the change in internal energy is equal to the heat applied to the system minus the work done by the system.
Now, if it's adiabatic, we know that this is 0. And if that's 0, we can add P delta V to both sides of this equation, and we will get that-- this is only true if it were adiabatic-- that delta U, our change in internal energy, plus our pressure times our change in volume, is equal to 0. And let's see if we can do this somehow, we can do something with this equation to get to that result that I'm trying to get to.
Because we're dealing with an ideal gas, we might as well. PV is equal to nRT. This should be emblazoned in your mind, at this point.
So what I want to do-- this is, right here, over a small change. I want to integrate eventually over all of the changes that occur during our adiabatic process. So let's see if we can simplify this before I break out the calculus.
Now we're going to integrate over a bunch of really small delta T's and delta V's. So let me just change those to our calculus terminology. We're going to do an infinite sum over infinitesimally small changes in delta T and delta V.
John: Hi, there I'm John Green.
This is Crash Course World History, and today we're gonna talk about Islam, which like Christianity and Judaism, grew up on the east coast of the Mediterranean, but unlike Christianity and Judaism, it's not terribly well understood in the West. For instance, you probably know what this is and what this is. You probably don't know what that is.
They were like snow boarders and skiers, or like the Westboro Baptist Church and everyone else. At its core, Islam is what we call a radical reforming religion, just as Jesus and Moses sought to restore Abrahamic monotheism after what they perceived as straying, so too did Muhammad. Muslims believe that God sent Muhammad as the final prophet to bring people back to the one true religion, which involves the worship of and submission to a single and all-powerful God.
There is no God, but God, and Muhammad is God's prophet, which is sometimes translated as there is no God but Allah, and Muhammad is Allah's prophet, which tries to make Muslims sound other, and ignores the fact that the Arabic word for God, whether you're Christian or Jewish or Muslim, is Allah.
Second, Salat, or ritual prayer five times a day, at dawn, noon, afternoon, sunset, and late evening, which are obligatory unless you haven't hit puberty, are too sick, or are menstruating. Keep it PG, thought bubble. Third, Sawm, the month-long fast during the month of Ramadan, in which Muslims do not eat or drink or smoke cigarettes during daylight hours.
I'm sorry if you're watching this, Uma Therman. Being part of the Ummah trumped all other ties, including tribal ties, which got Muhammad into some trouble and brings us, at last, back to history. So, as Muhammad's following in Mecca grew, the Ummah aroused the suspicion of the most powerful tribe in Mecca, the Quraysh.
For painters, a tint is a color plus white.
A shade is a color plus black
and a tone is a color plus gray.
After World War II with most of Europe in ruins, tension grew between the Soviet Union and the United States. It was clear that the next global superpower required the ability to both launch and successfully defend nuclear attacks from intercontinental ballistic missiles. In North America the most vulnerable point of attack was over the north pole.
United States and Canada was established, known as NORAD, or North American Aerospace Defense Command. An important line of defense with the semi-automatic ground environment.
In 1976 Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman devised an amazing trick to do this. First, let's explore how this trick is done using colors.
How could Alice and Bob agree on a secret color without Eve finding it out? The trick is based on two facts. One, it's easy to mix two colors together to make a third color.
Now, Alice keeps her private color, and sends her mixture to Bob.
And Bob keeps his private color and sends his mixture to Alice. Now the heart of the trick.
Alice and Bob add their private colors to the other person's mixture, and arrive at a shared secret color.
Notice how Eve is unable to determine this exact color since she needs one of their private colors to do so. And that is the trick. Now, to do this with numbers, we need a numerical procedure, which is easy in one direction, and hard in the other.
Now that we know what an angle is, let's think about how we can measure them--and we already hinted at one way to think about the measure of an angle in the last video when we said: "Look, this angle XYZ seems more open than angle BAC so maybe the measure of angle XYZ should be larger than the angle of BAC", and that is exactly the way we think about the measures of angles, but what I want to do in this video is come up with an exact way to measure an angle. So what I've drawn over here is a little bit of a half circle, and it looks very similar to a tool that you can buy at your local school supply store to measure angles.
Really anything that measures the openness-- so when you go into trigonometry you'll learn that you can measure angles not only in degrees but also using something called "radians", but I'll leave that to another day. Let's measure this other angle: "angle BAC". So once again I'll put A at the center, and then AC I'll put along this zero degree edge of this half circle or protractor, and then I'll put point AB in the--well, assuming I'm drawing it exactly the way that it is over there--normally instead of moving the angle you could actually move the protractor to the angle--it looks something like that.
Let's figure out 7/12 minus 6/13. And in order to be able to do this, we need to find a common denominator. We notice that they're not common right over here.
We have three different addition problems right over here... and what I want you to do (so you get the hang of things), is to pause the video and try them on your own. But as you do them, I want you to really keep in mind and think about what the carrying actually means. So I assume you've tried on your own, Now I'll work through them with you.
What does this "1" represent? Well, we put it in the "tens" place... one 10 represents 10. So all we've said is that 9 plus 6 is equal to 10 plus 5.
So this is an airplane here. Ok. So you probably already knew that.
We'll call that (L). L equals one half times ro times CL times V squared. It's that simple.
(V) here is the speed of the aircraft or fast its traveling.
And (CL) is something called the coefficient of lift. It's a number that gives us some information about the shape of the aircraft's wings. These things right here.
There is a similar equation for the drag per unit wing area (D). D equals one half ro, not CL, that wouldn't make any sense, but CD. As you can guess, it's the coefficient of drag times the velocity squared.
We've got a scale here, and as you see, the scale is balanced. And we have a question to answer. We have this mystery mass over here.
To figure out what this mystery mass is, we essentially just want this on one side of this scale But that by itself is not enough. We could just remove these three, but that won't do the job, because if we just remove these three, then the left side of this scale is clearly going to have less mass, and it will go up, and the right side will go down.
Rewrite the following expressions as the product of positive exponents, and then evaluate the expression when x is equal to 2 So let's do this first part They want us to rewrite it as the product of positive exponents, so they don't like the fact that we have this negative third power and the 5 to the negative second power so you want to rewrite those as negative exponents.
And to do that, we just have to remember that something to a negative power is just (let me write it over here) if I have x to the negative 2 power, this is the exact same thing as 1 over x to the positive 2 power. If I have a to the negative b power, this is the exact same thing as one over a to the b power You can get rid of that negative by just putting a 1 over this whole thing.
Let's review how China can maintain a trade in balance with the United States by artificially keeping its currency weak. So we have a simplified scenario. Where we have exchanged it of six Yuan per one dollar, we have Chinese manufacturer selling 50 million dollars worth of microwaves.
A few years ago, I felt like I was stuck in a rut, so I decided to follow in the footsteps of the great American philosopher, Morgan Spurlock, and try something new for 30 days.
The idea is actually pretty simple. Think about something you've always wanted to add to your life and try it for the next 30 days. It turns out 30 days is just about the right amount of time to add a new habit or subtract a habit --
Even last year, I ended up hiking up Mt. Kilimanjaro, the highest mountain in Africa. I would never have been that adventurous before I started my 30-day challenges.
But for the rest of my life, if I meet John Hodgman at a TED party,
I don't have to say, "I'm a computer scientist." No, no, if I want to, I can say, "I'm a novelist."
So here's my question to you: What are you waiting for? I guarantee you the next 30 days are going to pass whether you like it or not, so why not think about something you have always wanted to try and give it a shot!
As you might imagine World war I was one of the bloodiest events in frankly all of human history. I was thinking about putting pictures in here and I encourage you to do a picture search of WWl, of mass graves and people starving, soldiers dead,... trenches.
But the estimates that I see have on the order of 16 millions deaths during or due to WWI and if were to break down these deads we have 8 to 10 million in the military. So directly, in the military, this is the death of soldiers So this is the military.
Mary's rectangular poster is 36 inches by 20 inches.
Susan's rectangular poster is 26 inches by 30 inches. Which poster has a larger area and by how many square inches? So let's think about these.
Mary's poster is 36 inches by 20 inches. So it's 36 inches by 20 inches.
So it might look something like that. So the area is going to be 36 times 20 square inches. 36 times 2 is 72.
Susan's poster is 26 inches by 30 inches, so 26 inches by 30 inches. So Susan's poster might look something like that. That's Susan's poster, my best attempt to draw a rectangle.
We could do 26 times 3 and essentially add a 0 there. So 3 times 6 is 18. 3 times 2 is 6, plus 1 is 78.
Susan's.
Susan's poster has a larger area. And by how many square inches? Well, hers is 780 square inches while Mary's is 720 square inches.
So it's by 60 square inches. 780 minus 720 would be 60.
I'm going to take you on a journey into some hidden worlds inside your own body using the scanning electron microscope. These microscopes use a beam of electrons to illuminate things that are too small to be seen by the photons of visible light. And to put this in context, if you mentally divide one tiny millimeter into a thousand parts, each one of those parts is a micrometer, or micron for short.
If you think of culture as an iceberg, only a small fraction of it is visible. Food, flags, and festivals, which are often talked about in schools, are the visible parts that we rightly celebrate. However, only when we look deeper, under the water, are we able to focus on the common values that connect us.
In many parts of the Arab world and parts of south Asia, such as Bangladesh for example, the greeting of "as-salamu alaykum" can be translated to "peace be with you." The same is true as you walk through markets or into schools each morning in India, or Nepal, or Bhutan, where greetings of "namaste," which has not only a strong message of peace
- "the spirit in me greets the spirit in you" - but also its physical gesture, the palms brought together slowly at the heart, to honor a special place in each of us. In Myanmar, greetings of "mingalarbar" are met by bowing monks as they internalize a message where others add blessing to enhance the auspiciousness of the moment, or by giggling children as they scurry off to school. After many hours of hiking through the mountains of Lesotho, surrounded by the tranquility and rugged terrain, you are likely to meet a herdboy who has slept the night in a vacant rondoval and bellows out greetings of "lumela" or "khotso", which means "peace be with you."
If you took a moment to research further the meanings behind "shalom," or the Korean greeting, you would find that they too have deeply-seated connections to peace. However, they have become quick comments made to welcome, greet, and say hello, and in this overuse, have likely lost the focus that was originally intended when put into practice hundreds or thousands of years ago. In highlighting this simple evidence of ingrained behavior, we can create the necessary shift in thinking needed to incorporate flexibility and open-mindedness in us all when looking at the globalization of the world.
 Let's attempt to take the inverse of this 2 by 2 matrix. And you'll see the 2 by 2 matrices are about the only size of matrices that it's somewhat pleasant to take the inverse of.
We are asked to divide 99.061 or ninety nine and sixty one thousandths by 100. And there is a few ways to do it but all I'm going to do in this video is focus on kind of a faster way to think about it. And hopefully it will make sense to you.
Let's see if we can write 0.0727 as a fraction. Now let's just think about what places these are in. This is in the tenths place...
Find the mean, median, and mode of the following sets of numbers, and they give us the numbers right over here. So if someone just says "the mean", they're really referring to what we typically, in everyday language, call "the average". Sometimes it's called "the arithmetic mean" because you'll learn that there are actually other ways of calculating a mean.
What I wanna do in this video is introduce you to what I think is one of the neatest ideas in computer science and that is recursion. So the way we define this factorial function in the last two videos is actually an iterative definition.
Use a number line to compare 11.5 and 11.7. So let's draw a number line here. And I am going to focus between 11 and 12 because that's where our two numbers are sitting.
PROBLEM: "The scale on a map is 7 centimeters for every 10 kilometers - or 7 centimeters for 10 kilometers. If the distance between two cities is 60 kilometers - (So that's the actual distance.)
Every year in the United States alone, 2,077,000 couples make a legal and spiritual decision to spend the rest of their lives together ... (Laughter) and not to have sex with anyone else, ever. He buys a ring, she buys a dress. They go shopping for all sorts of things.
She takes him to Arthur Murray for ballroom dancing lessons. And the big day comes. And they'll stand before God and family and some guy her dad once did business with, and they'll vow that nothing, not abject poverty, not life-threatening illness, not complete and utter misery will ever put the tiniest damper on their eternal love and devotion.
Disrespect, boredom, too much time on Facebook, having sex with other people. But you can have the exact opposite of all of those things -- respect, excitement, a broken Internet connection, mind-numbing monogamy -- and the thing still can go to hell in a hand basket. So what's going on when it doesn't?
"Yeah, it was devastating when we lost everything in that fire, but it's kind of nice sleeping out here under the stars, and it's a good thing you've got all that body fat to keep us warm." One of my favorite studies found that the more willing a husband is to do house work, the more attractive his wife will find him. Because we needed a study to tell us this.
Bettie Davis, Joan Crawford, Hallie Berry, Hillary Swank,
Sandra Bullock, Reese Witherspoon, all of them single soon after taking home that statue. They actually call it the Oscar curse. It is the marriage kiss of death and something that should be avoided.
My husband and I have watched quite a few friends divide their assets and then struggle with being our age and single in an age of sexting and Viagra and eHarmony. And I'm thinking they've done more for my marriage than a lifetime of therapy ever could. So now you may be wondering, why does anyone get married ever?
I want to share with you some ideas about the secret power of time, in a very short time. Video: All right, start the clock please.
Let's tune into the conversation of the principals in Adam's temptation.
"Come on Adam, don't be so wishy-washy. Take a bite." "I did."
"One bite, Adam. Don't abandon Eve."
"I don't know, guys.
I don't want to get in trouble."
"Okay. One bite. What the hell?"
Walter Mischel, my colleague at Stanford, went back 14 years later, to try to discover what was different about those kids. There were enormous differences between kids who resisted and kids who yielded, in many ways. The kids who resisted scored 250 points higher on the SAT.
And those people, when they make their decisions in that format -- we're going to call them "present-oriented," because their focus is what is now. For others, the present is irrelevant. It's always about "What is this situation like that I've experienced in the past?"
We're going to call them "future-oriented." Their focus is on what will be. So, time paradox, I want to argue, the paradox of time perspective, is something that influences every decision you make, you're totally unaware of. Namely, the extent to which you have one of these biased time perspectives.
I'm sure that resonates with some of the TEDsters. (Laughter) And it resonated for me.
Determine the domain and range of the function f of x is equal to 3x squared plus 6x minus 2.
So, the domain of the function is: what is a set of all of the valid inputs, or all of the valid x values for this function? And, I can take any real number, square it, multiply it by 3, then add 6 times that real number and then subtract 2 from it. So essentially any number if we're talking about reals when we talk about any number.
And, for those of you who might say, well, you know, aren't all numbers real?
You may or may not know that there is a class of numbers, that are a little bit bizarre when you first learn them, called imaginary numbers and complex numbers. But, I won't go into that right now. But, most of the traditional numbers that you know of, they are part of the set of real numbers.
So, you take any real number and you put it here, you can square it, multiply it by 3, then add 6 times it and subtract 2. Now, the range, at least the way we've been thinking about it in this series of videos--
The range is set of possible, outputs of this function. Or if we said y equals f of x on a graph, it's a set of all the possible y values. And, to get a flavor for this, I'm going to try to graph this function right over here.
So, this is 3 minus 6 is negative 3 minus 2 is equal negative 5, and that actually is the vertex. And, you know the formula for the vertex, once again, is negative b over 2 a.
So, negative b. That's the coefficient on this term right over here.
It's negative 6 over 2 times this one right over here, 2 times 3. 2 times 3, this is equal to negative 1. So, that is the vertex, but let's just keep on going right over here.
When x is negative 2, y is negative 2. Y is negative 2 so that is that right over 3. So, that is the point, that is the point negative 2, negative 2.
Nothing less than negative 5.
Read the problem. So just to visualize this a little bit.
Let me draw a triangle here, just so we know what b and h are. This distance right over here is b, and this distance is height. Now they want us to solve this for the height.

The cofounder of the social, news, and entertainment website "Reddit" has been found dead. He certainly was a prodigy, although he never kinda thought of himself like that. He was totally unexcited about starting businesses and making money.
There is a profound sense of loss tonight in Highland Park, Aaron Swartz's hometown as loved ones say goodbye to one of the Internet's brightest light. Freedom, Open Access, and computer activists are mourning his loss. "An astonishing intellect," if you talk to people who knew him.
Growing up, you know, I slowly had this process realizing that all the things around me that people had told me were just the natural way of things were, or the way things would be, weren't natural at all. There were things that could be changed. And there were things, more importantly, were WRONG and should change.
Welcome to story reading time. The name of the book is "Paddington at the Fair." He was born in Highland Park and grew up here.
We all were curious children, but Aaron really liked learning and really liked teaching. "...We're going to learn the ABC backward."
"Z, Y, X, W, V, U, T..." I remember, he came home from his first Algebra class and he was like, "Noah, let me teach you Algebra!" and I'm like, "What IS Algebra?" He was always like that.
Aaron made an ATM using Macintosh and a cardboard box.
One year for Halloween, I didn't know what I wanted to be. And he thought it would be really really cool if I dressed up like his new favorite computer, which at that time, the original iMac. I mean, he hated dressing up for Halloween, but he loved convincing other people to dress up in things he wanted to see.
We all went to Cambridge when he won the ArsDigita prize and we had no clue what Aaron was doing. It was obvious that the prize was really important. Aaron soon became involved with online programming communities, then in the process of shaping a new tool for the Web.
There was this mailing list for people who are working on RSS, and XML more generally, and there was a person on it named Aaron Swartz who was combative but very smart, and who had lots of good ideas, and he didn't ever come to the face-to-face meetings, and they said, "You know, when are you gonna come out to one of these face-to-face meetings?" And he said, "You know, I don't think my mom would let me.
The piece that he was working on, RSS, was a tool that you can use to get summaries of things that are going on on other web pages.
Most commonly, you would use this for a blog.
You might have 10 or 20 people's blogs you wanna read. You use their RSS feeds, these summaries of what's going on on those other pages to create a unified list of all the stuff that's going on. Aaron was really young, but he understood the technology and he saw that it was imperfect and looked for ways to help make it better.
So his mom started bundling him on planes in Chicago. We'd pick him up in San Francicso. We'd introduce him to interesting people to argue with, and we'd marvel at his horrific eating habits.
The circle is arguably the most fundamental shape in our universe, whether you look at the shapes of orbits of planets, whether you look at wheels, whether you look at things on kind of a molecular level. The circle just keeps showing up over and over and over again. So it's probably worthwhile for us to understand some of the properties of the circle.
So let's say that somebody had some circle over here -- let's say they had this circle, and the first time with not that good of a tape measure, they measured around the circle and they said hey, it's roughly equal to 3 meters when I go around it. And when I measure the diameter of the circle, it's roughly equal to 1. OK, that's interesting.
It's one of these fundamental things about the universe that just makes you think that there's some order to it. But anyway, how can we use this in I guess our basic mathematics? So we know, or I'm telling you, that the ratio of the circumference to the diameter -- when I say the ratio,
Pi is just this number. I could write 3.14159 and just keep going on and on and on, but that would be a waste of space and it would just be hard to deal with, so people just write this Greek
letter pi there. So, how can we relate this? We can multiply both sides of this by the diameter and we could say that the circumference is equal to pi times the diameter.
Or since the diameter is equal to 2 times the radius, we could say that the circumference is equal to pi times 2 times the radius. Or the form that you're most likely to see it, it's equal to 2 pi r. So let's see if we can apply that to some problems.
Remember pi is just a number.
Pi is 3.14159 going on and on and on. So if I multiply 6 times that, maybe I'll get 18 point something something something. If you have your calculator you might want to do it, but for simplicity people just tend to leave our numbers in terms of pi.
Now I don't know what this is if you multiply 6 times 3.14159, I don't know if you get something close to 19 or 18, maybe it's approximately 18 point something something something. I don't have my calculator in front of me. But instead of writing that number, you just write 6 pi there.
Well if this radius is 3, the diameter is just twice that. So it's just going to be 3 times 2 or 3 plus 3, which is equal to 6 meters. So the circumference is 6 pi meters, the diameter is 6 meters, the radius is 3 meters.
So to solve for this we would just divide both sides of this equation by pi. The diameter would equal 10 meters over pi or 10 over pi meters. And that is just a number.
Pi is just 3.14159 and it just keeps going on and on and on. There's actually thousands of books written about pi, so it's not like -- I don't know if there's thousands, I'm exaggerating, but you could write books about this number. But it's just a number.
But most the time people just realize they like leaving things in terms of pi. Anyway, I'll leave you there. In the next video we'll figure out the area of a circle.
In the last video on the Drake equation we tried out some numbers we just made some assumptions that seemed reasonable at least to me and we got that there should be 12.5 detectable civilizations in the Milky Way Galaxy and I've talked about a bunch of reasons about why we are not detecting them but I left out one of the most obvious reasons that we are not detecting them and it was rightfully pointed out in the comments bellow that video and thats just the signal might be too weak if theres 12.5 if there's on the order of 10, 11, 12 detectable civilizations in our galaxy they could be quite far from us this isn't the Milky Way but this is a galaxy that probably doesn't look too different from our Milky Way we could obviously never get this vantage point of our galaxy well at least not for a while not unless we can travel quite far away from it but lets say we are over here you could imagine if the ten civilizations or the twelve civilizations are here, one, two, three, four there's probably a lot more at the center actually because that's where our density is higher so let me put it here so one, two, three, four, five, six, seven eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve the closest of them might be tens of thousands of light years away from us and there might be a lot of stuff in between all sorts of crazy things happening stars exploding all sorts of signals that we are receiving and it might just be that the signals from those civilizations are too weak to reach us or that there is too much interference from all of the other craziness that's happening around the galaxy there's also these other reasons that I've talked about in the last video maybe they've gone beyond using radio as a form of communication and thats why.. or they never used it to begin with and that's why we don't even see them ever using it or they used if for a very short period a kind of transition period and maybe in a hundred years we'll discover the next best thing the other idea behind why we're probably or maybe why we might not be able to detect civilizations is that well there might be a lot fewer than ten when I did the Drake equation right over here I just made a bunch of assumptions none of these seemed crazy but I assumed a reality where you didn't have these kind of cataclysmic events in the galaxy at regular intervals but we know there are cataclysmic events that happen in our galaxy in other galaxies the one we know the most about although there are all sorts of things that we don't know much about are gamma ray bursts and these are still kind of trying to be understood GAMMA RAY BURSTS and you can watch the video on quasars those are essentially of highly energetic rays being released when all this material is being kind of absorbed into super massive black holes at the centers of galaxies that tend to be very very very often billions of light years away and gamma rays are one of the things that get emitted from those but you can also have gamma ray bursts within galaxies we believe maybe certain types of stars when they collapse into black holes you have this burst of gamma rays there might be certain kinds of neutron stars with the right properties that might every now and then release gamma rays and the view is is that if there is a civilization that is within a few thousand light years near one of these gamma ray bursts and its in wrong place its kind of in the path of the burst then its a good chance that those civilizations will be completely wiped out that those planets will become sterilized because there is so much radiation coming out from that gamma ray there's even some theories that some of the extinction events that have happened in Earth's history we are not talking about the dinosaurs we are talking about billions of years ago maybe a billion years ago or two billion years ago that these might have been caused by relatively local gamma ray bursts the theory is that these might hit earth on the order of once every billion years and if you think about the galaxy as a whole we're kind of in.. our solar system is orbiting the galaxy its kind of a nice distance from the center of the galaxy the closer you get into the center the higher densities of stars you have so you can imagine if earth gets hit with one of these gamma rays bursts every couple of billion years you can imagine something closer the center of the galaxy gets hit with these gamma ray bursts much much much more frequently just because there is more activity there there are more stars that are closer by more stars that are aging more stars that might be collapsing into black holes so the simple answer is we don't know there could be a thousand civilizations out there and we're not sophisticated enough to notice them just yet or there might be very very few because all of this craziness that happens in the galaxy or who knows there might be none although I find that kind of... that's not too exciting so I try not to think about that one

[unintelligible] take paintings out of context and it's sometimes hard to remember that works of art were meant for domestic environments.
Dr. Harris:
Or churches or even in the case of the paintings that we're looking at now, Pleasure Pavilions.
Dr. Zucker:
We're in the Fragonard room at the Frick Collection and we're looking at one of the late Rococo masterpieces.
Dr. Harris:
Fragonard's the Progress of Love.
Dr. Zucker: The first canvas shows the inception of love. We see this young boy offering a rose to this rather surprised young girl.
Dr. Harris: And in the next panel, we see them having a kind of surreptitious meeting.
Dr. Zucker:
Followed by an allegory of the consummation of love, the crowning. This would refer to the marriage.
Dr. Harris: And then in the last scene, the two lovers nostalgically looking at their early love letters together. And these four panels were made for Madame du Barry, the mistress of King Louis XV.
Dr. Zucker:
The consort of the king himself. Let's look at one of the panels. Let's look at the meeting.
Dr. Zucker:
Right next to a window.
Dr. Zucker: That's important because the window would have looked out onto the back of the pavilion onto the garden.
Dr. Harris:
Overflowing (chuckles)
Overflowing, yeah, representation of nature, would've had a nice parallel to the landscape outside.
Dr. Harris:
It's such a dramatic image. One really gets a sense of a secret meeting.
Dr. Zucker: One art historian suggested that the pose of the young woman is coming directly out of 18th century theater at this moment.
Dr. Harris:
So, we see her suitor climbing up the ladder.
Dr. Zucker:
So, this is a little bit of a Romeo and Juliet.
Dr. Harris:
It is and they don't wanna get caught.
Dr. Zucker:
Her left hand seems to be saying,
"Slow down. Wait a moment. "Let me see if the coast is clear."
Dr. Harris:
(laughs) Yeah.
Dr. Zucker:
There is this wonderful sense of anticipation.
Their bodies leaned toward one another and formed a pyramid that leads our eye up to the figure of Cupid and Venus.
Dr. Zucker:
So as if the painting wasn't clear enough. They are just gonna make sure that we know what this is about. Venus, of course, the Goddess of Love.
Dr. Harris:
Her pose mirrors the trees behind her that leaned up in toward the right side of the canvas. So, there's a V-shaped parting where we see the sky between Venus and Cupid.
We referred a moment ago that the foliage mirroring the garden outside and that's the thing that I love so much about Fragonard. The sense that nature can't be controlled. It overflows everywhere.
Dr. Zucker:
Madame du Barry would actually reject these panels and what a mistake. These are Fragonard's great masterpiece.
Naturally, art historians have a couple of theories why she rejected them.
So, Madame du Barry hires instead an artist who painted in a more classical style named Vien.
Dr. Zucker:
Dr. Harris:
It was precisely paintings about indulgence and pleasure that the philosophers of the enlightment attacked and associated with the corruption of the aristocracy and the monarchy.
Dr. Zucker:
These paintings about love and pleaure, were meant to be situated in the Pleasure Pavilion
Dr. Harris:
(laughs)
Dr. Zucker:
What could be a better exemplar of everything that was wrong with France?
And everything that the revolution would fight against and everything that the new style of Neoclassicism would reject.
So interesting that Madame du Barry, herself rejects these paintings.
Some art historians have suggested that the young woman, perhaps looked a little bit too much like Madame du Barry and that the young male lover, may have looked a little bit too much like Louis XV.
Dr. Harris:
Now, when Madame du Barry rejected these paintings and sent them back to Fragonard, he was never paid. He later added 10 other panels and all of them fortunately, can be seen here together at the Frick Collection.
It's interesting to think about Fragonard coming at this later moment of the Rococo and the imminence of the revolution. David will protect Fragonard during the revolution and find him a post within the Arts Administration.
And so, Fragonard's career spans this interesting moment of the late Rococo and Neoclassicism in the revolution.
We're in the British Museum, and we're looking at one of the most important objects in the collection - the Rosetta Stone. It's in a glass case, surrounded by people who are taking pictures of it. People love it!
And the answer is that Breadth - First Search always considers the shortest paths first, and in this case, there's 2 paths of length 1, and 1, the paths from Arad to Zerind and Arad to Timisoara, so those would be the 2 paths that would be considered.
Now, let's suppose that the tie is broken in some way and we chose this path from Arad to Zerind. Now, we want to expand that node. We remove it from the frontier and put it in the explored list and now we say, "What paths are we going to add?"
Farming as we now associate the word has been around for about 7 to 10 thousand years and.. when we think of farming we imagine a farmer planting seeds and later harvesting the crops or maybe having cattle that they can allow to graze and using that cattle later either for meat or milk or wool. But there's actually a different type of farming that predates this association with what we can call traditional form of farming. And it predates it by several tens of thousands of years and we believe it started with the original inhabitants of Australia.
 Sarah has $48. She wants to save 1/3 of her money for a trip.
Let's talk about manias.
Let's start with Beatlemania. (Recording of crowd roaring) Hysterical teenagers, crying, screaming, pandemonium.
I don't want to let myself down! How many people are trying to learn English worldwide? Two billion of them.
In Latin America, in India, in Southeast Asia, and most of all, in China.
I want to change my life! JW: So is English mania good or bad?
Most cells in the human body just go about their business on a daily basis in a fairly respectable way. Let's say that I have some cell here. This could be maybe a skin cell or really any cell in any tissue in the body.
They'll recognize that, and say, you know, I'm going to stop growing a little bit. That's called contact inhibition.
And so they'll just start growing. And then let's say one of them experiences a little defect, and he says, you know what, gee, something's a little bit wrong with me. I, the cell, recognize this in myself, and the cells will actually kill themselves.
Now, a lot of neoplasms, well they don't have to form a body like this. Sometimes they might somehow circulate in the body, but most of the time they form this kind of big lump. And if they get large enough, they're noticeable.
And not only does it grow like crazy, but it becomes invasive. And invasive means that it doesn't care what's going on around it. It just wants to infiltrate everything.
You might have heard the word metastasis, and that's just the notion of these run amok cells all of a sudden being able to travel to different parts of the body. And I think you guys know what we call these cells. These cells that aren't respecting their cellular neighborhood.
In this video we are going to look at the relationship between white light and color by recreating a portion of Newton's prism experiment as presented in a letter to the royal society in 1671 but first a little bit of background.
At the time of his experiment the prevailing theory was that white light was a color of light and that other colors could be created by modifing the white light some how. For instance this red piece of plastic would be described as changing this white light into red light. They also had knowledge about how light behaved at the boundary of 2 materials.
Newton was working on designing lenses for telescopes when he decided to investigate the phenomena prismatic colors. Those are the color that occur when you pass white light through a prism. So you obtained a triangular prism and you pass some white light through it and you saw a rainbow just as you expected.
So a lot of books draw this system where we start with our original prism and we put a second one in something like this and to our eyes this looks it's working but it's not really, all that's really happening is the white hasn't had enough time to spread. So it looks like it's white but if you had a very sensitive instrument you would be able to tell that there is a changing color across this and you could see it more clearly by eye if we placed this prism further down. Over here it's clear that there is a change in color across the width of the beam.
Voiceover: I'm Charles Prober. And in this video, we're going to talk about pulmonary disease caused by tuberculosis.
OK, hopefully, my tool is working now. But anyway, so we were saying when x is equal to minus 0.001, so we're getting closer and closer to 0 from the negative side, f of x is equal to minus 1,000, right? You can just evaluate it yourself, right?
"The laws of nature are but the mathematical thoughts of God." And this is a quote by Euclid of Alexandria. He was a Greek mathematician and philosopher who lived about 300 years before Christ
The laws of nature are but the mathematical thoughts of God. That math underpins all of the laws of nature.
And the word "geometry" itself has Greek roots.
"Geo" comes from Greek for "Earth".
"Metry" comes from Greek for "measurement". You're probably used to something like the "metric" system.
And Euclid is considered to be the father of geometry. (not because he was the first person who studied geometry), you could imagine the very first humans might have studied geometry. They might have looked at two twigs on the ground that looked something like that.
When you talk about Greek mathematicians like Pythagoras (who came before Euclid). The reason why people often talk about "Euclidean geometry" is around 300 B.C. (and this over here is a picture of Euclid painted by Raphael, and no one really knows what Euclid looked like or even when he was born or when he died, so this is just Raphael's impression of what Euclid might have looked like while he was teaching in Alexandria). But what made Euclid the "Father of Geometry" is really his writing of "Euclid's Elements".
And, "Euclid's Elements" was essentially a 13-volume textbook (and arguably the most famous textbook of all time). And what he did in those thirteen volumes was a rigorous, thoughtful, logical march through geometry, number theory and solid geometry (geometry in three-dimensions).
And this right over here is the frontispiece of the English version--- or the first translation of the English version---of "Euclid's Elements".
This was done in 1570. But it was obviously first written in Greek, and, during the Middle Ages, that knowledge was shepherded by the Arabs and it was translated into Arabic. And then eventually the late Middle Ages translated it into Latin and then eventually English.
And when I say that he did a "rigiorous march", Euclid didn't just say,
"the square of the length of two sides of a right triangle is going to be the same as the square of the hypotenuse..." and all these other things (and we'll go into depth about what all these mean). He says, "I don't want to feel good that it's probably true. I want to prove to myself that it's true."
was he started with basic assumptions.
And those basic assumptions in "geometric speak" are called "axioms" or "postulates". And from them he proved, he deduced other statements or "propositions" (these are sometimes called "theorems"). And then he says, "Now, I know.
He didn't just say, "Well, every circle I've sat in has this property."
He said, "I've now proven that this is true". And then, from there, he could go and deduce other propositions or "theorems" (and we can use some of our original "axioms" to do that). And what's special about that is no one had really done that before.
A rigorous "march" through a subject so that he could build this scaffold of "axioms" and "postulates" and "theorems" and "propositions" (and theorems and propositions are essentially the same thing).
And for about 2,000 years after Euclid (so this is an unbelievable shelf life for a textbook!), people didn't view you as educated if you had not read and understood Euclid's "Elements".
And "Euclid's Elements" (the book itself) was the second-most printed book in the Western World after the Bible. This is a math textbook second only to the Bible. When the first printing presses came out they said "Okay, let's print the bible.
"Let's print 'Euclid's Elements'". And to show that this is relevant into the fairly recent past (although it may depend whether or not you argue that 150-160 years ago is a recent past), this right here is a direct quote from Abraham Lincoln (obviously one of the great American Presidents).
"In the course of my law reading, I constantly came upon the word 'demonstrate'. I thought at first that I understood its meaning, but soon became satisfied that I did not. I said to myself, what do I do when I demonstrate more than when I reason or prove?
Something more rigorous---more than just simple feeling good about something or reasoning through it. "...I consulted Webster's Dictionary..." (so Webster's dictionary was around even in Lincoln's era)
"...they told of certain proof---proof beyond the possibility of doubt. But I could form no idea of what sort of proof that was. I thought a great many things were proven beyond the possibility of doubt without recourse to any such extraordinary process of reasoning as I understood 'demonstration' to be.
I consulted all the dictionaries and books of reference I could find but with no better results. You might as well have defined 'blue' to a blind-man. At last I said, 'Lincoln, you never can make a lawyer if you do not understand what 'demonstrate' means.
I could give any proposition in the six books of Euclid at sight."
(This refers to the six books concerned with planar geometry.) "...I then found out what 'demonstrate' means and went back to my law study."
So one of the greatest American Presidents of all time felt that, in order to be a great lawyer, he had to understood---be able to prove any proposition in the six books of "Euclid's Elements" at sight. And also, once he was in the White House he continued to do this to "fine-tune" his mind to become a great President. And so, what we're going to be doing in the geometry playlist is essentially that.
Let's multiply 9 times...8,000...8,085. That should be a pretty fun little calculation to do. So like always let's just rewrite this, so I'm going to write the 8,085.
Let's give ourselves a little bit of practice with percentages. So let's ask ourselves, what percent of-- I don't know, let's say what percent of 16 is 4?
The word "cent" you know from cents and century. It relates to the number 100. So it's per 100.
Simplify 48/64 to lowest terms. Let's see if we can visualize this. So we have 64.
It's 3 times 16, and 64 is 4 times 16. Now this is interesting. So this 48 that we drew in magenta right here, we could view this as three groups of 16.
Meet Tony. He's my student. He's about my age, and he's in San Quentin State Prison.
When Tony was 16 years old, one day, one moment,
"It was mom's gun. Just flash it, scare the guy. He's a punk.
I say, 'Let's do this.'" And those three words, Tony's going to remember, because the next thing he knows, he hears the pop. There's the punk on the ground, puddle of blood.
And that's felony murder -- 25 to life, parole at 50 if you're lucky, and Tony's not feeling very lucky. So when we meet in my philosophy class in his prison and I say, "In this class, we will discuss the foundations of ethics,"
Tony interrupts me. "What are you going to teach me about right and wrong? I know what is wrong.
I want to know what is wrong. I want to know what I know."
What Tony sees in that moment is the project of philosophy, the project that begins in wonder -- what Kant called "admiration and awe at the starry sky above and the moral law within." What can creatures like us know of such things?
It is the project that always takes us back to the condition of existence -- what Heidegger called "the always already there." It is the project of questioning what we believe and why we believe it -- what Socrates called "the examined life."
Socrates, a man wise enough to know that he knows nothing.
Socrates died in prison, his philosophy intact. So Tony starts doing his homework. He learns his whys and wherefores, his causes and correlations, his logic, his fallacies.
That's Plato, Descartes, Nietzsche and Bill Clinton. So when he gives me his final paper, in which he argues that the categorical imperative is perhaps too uncompromising to deal with the conflict that affects our everyday and challenges me to tell him whether therefore we are condemned to moral failure, I say, "I don't know.
"Let's do this." Thank you. (Applause)
We live in an incredibly busy world. The pace of life is often frantic, our minds are always busy, and we're always doing something. So with that in mind, I'd like you just to take a moment to think, when did you last take any time to do nothing?
So that's no emailing, texting, no Internet, no TV, no chatting, no eating, no reading. Not even sitting there reminiscing about the past or planning for the future. Simply doing nothing.
Everything's going fine, and we see the anxious thought. "Oh, I didn't realize I was worried about that." You go back to it, repeat it.
 In this video, I want to cover several topics that are all related. And on some level, they're really simple, but on a whole other level, they tend to confuse people a lot.
And the,the idea is actually pretty straightforward. If I have, let's say,let's same the same container. Let me do it in a slightly different container here, just to talk about diffusion.
But anyway, this whole process-- we went from a container of high concentration to a container of low concentration and the particles would have spread from the low concentration container to the high concentration container. So they diffused. This is diffusion.
Higher concentration, higher concentration It's all relative, right? It's higher than this guy,higher concentration
Lower concentrarion And there are words for these things. This solution with a high concentration is called a hypertonic solution.
Hyoer, Hypertonic solution
Hyper, in general, meaning having a lot of something, having too much of something.
And this lower concentration is hypo, hypotonic
Hypotonic solution,lower concentration You might have heard maybe one of your relatives, if they haven't had a meal in awhile say, I'm hypoglycemic. That means that they have not-- they're feeling
And then in hypotonic, not too much of the solute so you have a low concentration. These are good words to know. So in general, diffusion-- if there's no barriers to the diffusion like we had here, you will have the solute go from a high concentration or hypertonic solution if they can travel to a hypotonic solution, to a hypo, where the concentration is lower.
Permeable means it allows things to pass.
Semi-permeables means it's not completely permeable. So semi-permeable-- in this context, I'm saying I allow water to pass through the membrane. So water can pass, but sugar cannot.
So if we were to zoom in on the actual membrane itself-- maybe the membrane looks like this. I'm going to zoom in on this membrane. So it has little holes in the membrane, just like that.
The outside has a lower concentration so it's hypotonic.
Now, if these openings were big enough, based on what we just talked about-- these guys are bouncing around, water is travelling in either direction, and equal probability or-- actually I'm going to talk about that in a second. If everything was wide open, it would be equal probability, but if it was wide open, these guys eventually would bounce their ways over to this side and you'd probably end up with equal concentrations eventually. And so you would have your traditional diffusion, where high concentration of solute to low concentrations of solute.
But water-- if you flip it the other way-- if you've used sugar as the solvent, then you could say, we're going from a high concentration of water to a low concentration of water. I don't want to confuse you too much. This is what tends to confuse people, but just think about what's going to happen.
You've probably heard learning by osmosis-- if you put a book against your head, maybe it'll just seep into your brain. Same idea. That's where the word comes from.
Osmosis is the diffusion of water. And usually you're talking about the diffusion of water as a solvent and usually it's in the context of a semi-permeable membrane, where the actual solute cannot travel through the membrane. Anyway, hopefully you've found that useful and not completely confusing.
What is the Higgs? Since 1964 we've had this idea proposed by Englert, Brout and Higgs that empty space is like a medium and as particles travel through this medium some of them interact with it, some of them don't interact with it. The ones that do interact with this medium, they acquire masses, and the ones that pass through it without interacting, those are massless particles.
The Higgs boson has this job of giving masses to all the other elementary particles.
If you look at the basic equations of the Standard Model, as written on my T-shirt, they're very symmetric, that way in which all the different particles appear is the same. At least on the top two lines there is nothing to distinguish particles that have different masses for example. But this symmetry has to be broken, electrons are lighter than muons, the top quark is much much heavier than the quarks that make up everyday nuclei.
Let's review what happened in the last video because, in general, it's just kind of confusing and it's always good to see it a second time. And then we can think a little bit about how these market dynamics could be manipulated so that you don't have the Chinese currency getting more expensive. So in the last video, we started off with an exchange rate of 10 Yuan per (US) dollar.
The American manufacturer -- and let's say that these are the only two actors in our scenario -- has 500 Yuan that he needs to convert into $50. So if we just look over here, here's someone who wants to convert (into) 1,000 Yuan. He wants to convert (his dollars) into 1,000 Yuan.
And then we said, at that exchange (rate) -- and actually I'm going to change the numbers a little bit, just to make it a little bit cleaner -- at that exchange rate -- at 8 Yuan per dollar -- these 10-Yuan dolls would now cost $1.25. And let's say that at $1.25, in the United States, there is demand for 60 dolls. (I'm changing the numbers a little bit from the last video just to make the numbers work out a little bit better.)
Five years ago, I experienced a bit of what it must have been like to be Alice in Wonderland.
Penn State asked me, a communications teacher, to teach a communications class for engineering students. And I was scared. (Laughter)
I experienced what Alice must have when she went down that rabbit hole and saw that door to a whole new world. That's just how I felt as I had those conversations with the students. I was amazed at the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderland as well.
I've noticed something interesting about society and culture. Everything risky requires a license. So, learning to drive, owning a gun, getting married.
Nobody ever sits down and tells you, "This is how it works." So today I'm going to tell you ten things that you thought everybody knew, but it turns out they don't. First of all, on the web, if you want to scroll down, don't pick up the mouse and use the scroll bar.
If you want Texas, go T, T, and you jump right to that thing without even opening the pop-up menu. Also on the web, when the text is too small, what you do is hold down the Control key and hit plus, plus, plus. You make the text larger with each tap.
If you're on the Mac, it might be Command instead.
When you're typing on your Blackberry, Android, iPhone, don't bother switching layouts to the punctuation layout to hit the period and then a space, then try to capitalize the next letter. Just hit the space bar twice. The phone puts the period, the space, and the capital for you.
Go space, space. It is totally amazing. Also when it comes to cell phones, on all phones, if you want to redial somebody that you've dialed before, all you have to do is hit the call button, and it puts the last phone number into the box for you, and at that point you can hit call again to actually dial it.
No need to go to the recent calls list if you're trying to call somebody just hit the call button again. Something that drives me crazy: When I call you and leave a message on your voice mail,
I hear you saying, "Leave a message," and then I get these 15 seconds of freaking instructions, like we haven't had answering machines for 45 years! (Laughter)
Unfortunately, the carriers didn't adopt the same keystroke, so it's different by carrier, so it devolves upon you to learn the keystroke for the person you're calling.
Type the word "define" and the word you want to know. You don't even have to click anything. There's the definition as you type.
It's also a complete FAA database. Type the name of the airline and the flight. It shows you where the flight is, the gate, the terminal, how long until it lands.
You don't need an app. It's also unit and currency conversion. Again, you don't have to click one of the results.
Shutter lag is the time between your pressing the shutter button and the moment the camera actually snaps. It's extremely frustrating on any camera under $1,000. (Camera click) (Laughter)
B for blackout, to black out the slide, make everybody look at you, and then when you're ready to go on, you hit B again, and if you're really on a roll, you can hit the W key for "whiteout," and you white out the slide, and then you can hit W again to un-blank it. So I know I went super fast. If you missed anything, I'll be happy to send you the list of these tips.
We're asked to select which fractions add together to make 25 over 22, or 25/22. You can use as many fractions as you need. Put all unused fractions into the trash can.
We're asked to use the distributive property to factor this expression. There should be no fractions inside the parentheses in your final answer. So we have 1/2 plus 3/2 m.
Determine the domain and range for the relation described by the table and so, what they want us to say, what they want us to figure out, when they say the domain what are all the possible inputs that we could put into, this case, a relation and later we'll see a function and so over here, i guess one way to think about it the inputs that this relationship is defined for and so you can view the x as the input so when x is -1, y is 3 when x is 3, y is -2 when x is 3, again, y is 2 that's why we can't describe this as a function here because we have two y values for a given x value but it can be a relation when x is 4, y is 8 when x is 6, y is -1 so to answer the first part, when they ask us what is the domain of this relation they're really just saying what are all of the inputs, what are all of the x values for which this relation is defined? and they list the x values over here so it is a set, and that is what these curly brackets mean that i'm about to describe a set it is the set of the numbers -1, 3, 4, and 6 so all we're saying here if we saying the domain of this relation is these 4 numbers it says that this relation is defined for any of these four numbers if you give any of these numbers as an x value there is a y, at least one y value associated with it now, when they talk about the range of this relation and the idea also applies to functions, which are a more specific class of relations you can view them as a well behaved relation the range is all the possible output that this relation can give you given the inputs, what are all the possible values that this relation can take on? so here you'll take a look at all the possible y values that this relation can take on we can write them in order, or we don't have to write them in order, but i'll just write them in order actually let's just go straight this way a set does not imply some type of order, it just means a collection of things so the range here, well our y value can take on the value 3, it can take on the value 2, it can take on the value 8, and it can take on the value -1 and we're done! these are the x values for which this relation is defined then you can actually find an association or relationship and these are all the y values these are kind of all the outputs of the relation that it can take on we just look right over here to find them
We're told that as part of an experiment about train speed, 4 different train conductors measured the distance that they covered over a certain amount of time during a recent journey. So these are the 4 trains. This is how long it took them to go this many miles.
Simplify the cube root of 125, x to the sixth, y to the third power. So, taking the cube root of something is the same as raising that something to the one third power. So, this is equal to 125, x to the sixth, y to the third power, raised to the one third power.
Let's explore a few more methods for solving systems of equations. Let's say I have the equation, 3x plus 4y is equal to 2.5. And I have another equation, 5x minus 4y is equal to 25.5.
And it's probably not obvious, even though it's sitting right in front of your face. Well, what if we just added this equation to that equation? What I mean by that is, what if we were to add 5x minus 4y to the left-hand side, and add 25.5 to the right-hand side?
And remember, when you're doing any equation, if I have any equation of the form-- well, really, any equation-- Ax plus By is equal to C, if I want to do something to this equation, I just have to add the same thing to both sides of the equation. So I could, for example, I could add D to both sides of the equation.
Because D is equal to D, so I won't be changing the equation.
You would get Ax plus By, plus D is equal to C plus D. And we've seen that multiple, multiple times. Anything you do to one side of the equation, you have to do to the other side.
If you just add these two together, they are going to cancel out. They're going to be plus 0y. Or that whole term is just going to go away.
So we know that 3 times x, 3 times 7 over 2-- I'm just substituting the x value we figured out into this top equation-- 3 times 7 over 2, plus 4y is equal to 2.5. Let me just write that as 5/2. We're going to stay in the fraction world.
So this is going to be 21 over 2 plus 4y is equal to 5/2. Subtract 21 over 2 from both sides.
So minus 21 over 2, minus 21 over 2. The left-hand side-- you're just left with a 4y, because these two guys cancel out-- is equal to-- this is 5 minus 21 over 2. That's negative 16 over 2.
5 times 7/2 is 35 over 2 minus 4 times negative 2, so minus negative 8. That's equivalent to-- let's see, this is 17.5 plus 8. And that indeed does equal 25.5.
So here it says, Nadia and Peter visit the candy store.
Nadia buys 3 candy bars and 4 Fruit Roll-Ups for $2.84.
Peter also buys 3 candy bars, but can only afford 1 additional Fruit Roll-Up. His purchase costs $1.79. What is the cost of each candy bar and each Fruit Roll-Up?
So what does this first statement tell us?
Nadia buys 3 candy bars, so the cost of 3 candy bars is going to be 3x.
And 4 Fruit Roll-Ups. Plus 4 times y, the cost of a Fruit Roll-Up. This is how much Nadia spends.
3 candy bars, 4 Fruit Roll-Ups. And it's going to cost $2.84. That's what this first statement tells us.
Peter also buys 3 candy bars, but could only afford 1 additional Fruit Roll-Up. So plus 1 additional Fruit Roll-Up. His purchase cost is equal to $1.79.
Well, like in the problem we did a little bit earlier in the video, what if we were to subtract this equation, or what if we were to subtract 3x plus y from 3x plus 4y on the left-hand side, and subtract $1.79 from the right-hand side? And remember, by doing that, I would be subtracting the same thing from both sides of the equation.
If I subtract 3x plus y, that is the same thing as negative 3x minus y, if you just distribute the negative sign.
So you get negative 3x minus y-- maybe I should make it very clear this is not a plus sign; you could imagine I'm multiplying the second equation by negative 1-- is equal to negative $1.79.
You could imagine I'm multiplying it by negative 1, and now I'm going to add the left-hand side to the left-hand side of this equation, and the right-hand side to the right-hand side of that equation. And what do we get?
I won't even write it down. You get 4x minus-- sorry, 4y minus y. That is 3y.
And that is going to be equal to $2.84 minus $1.79. What is that? That's $1.05.
So 3y is equal to $1.05. Divide both sides by 3.
y is equal to-- what's $1.05 divided by 3? So 3 goes into $1.05. It goes into 1 zero times.
Which was originally, if you remember before I multiplied it by negative 1, it was 3x plus y is equal to $1.79. So that means that 3x plus the cost of a Fruit Roll-Up, 0.35 is equal to $1.79. If we subtract 0.35 from both sides, what do we get?
3 goes into 24 eight times. 8 times 3 is 24. No remainder.
So I'm here to explain why I'm wearing these ninja pajamas. And to do that, I'd like to talk first about environmental toxins in our bodies.
So some of you may know about the chemical Bisphenol A, BPA. It's a material hardener and synthetic estrogen that's found in the lining of canned foods and some plastics. So BPA mimics the body's own hormones and causes neurological and reproductive problems.
The Center for Disease Control in the U.S. says we have 219 toxic pollutants in our bodies, and this includes preservatives, pesticides and heavy metals like lead and mercury. To me, this says three things. First, don't become a cannibal.
The Infinity Burial Project, an alternative burial system that uses mushrooms to decompose and clean toxins in bodies.
The Infinity Burial Project began a few years ago with a fantasy to create the Infinity Mushroom -- a new hybrid mushroom that would decompose bodies, clean the toxins and deliver nutrients to plant roots, leaving clean compost. But I learned it's nearly impossible to create a new hybrid mushroom.
The Decompiculture Society shares a vision of a cultural shift, from our current culture of death denial and body preservation to one of decompiculture, a radical acceptance of death and decomposition. Accepting death means accepting that we are physical beings who are intimately connected to the environment, as the research on environmental toxins confirms. And the saying goes, we came from dust and will return to dust.
 I now want to introduce you to the concept of leverage. And then in future videos, we'll talk about this more in terms of what leverage does and when it's good and when it's bad.
Let me just do one more loan. Let's say I make another loan for 300. Loan B-- and I can give that.
Let's think a little bit about leverage. And leverage is essentially, how much assets do you control with a certain amount of equity? So in our example right now, what is our equity?
So, assets are equal to 1,000 gold pieces. So a lot of times people-- when they talk about leverage, you might hear someone say, 2:1 leverage. Well, that means the ratio of the assets to the equity is 2:1.
In this case, the ratio of our assets to equity-- so we have assets to equity leverage, is what people say-- in this case, it's 1,000 to 300-- or what is it?
10:3.
You seldom hear 10:3 leverage.
You'll hear people talking in terms of 10:1 or 2:1, or something to one, but 10:3 is a fair leverage ratio. It tells you just how many assets we're controlling with a certain amount of equity. I guess a very good reason why a bank wants to do this, because if it's making more money on its assets than it's paying on its liabilities, in theory, a bank will want to take on as much leverage as possible, right?
Because with this original 300 investment, every time it adds some assets and some liabilities, it's going to make a difference. It's going to make the spread on that money and so it wants to keep doing that.
But there's a downside to leverage because what if the bank-- what if some of these loans aren't so good? your What if some of these loans just don't turn out to be so good? So leverage, when things are good, when they go on the upside, it kind of multiplies how much money you're going to make. But as you're going to see in about a second, on the down side, leverage also multiplies the loss you would take.
So notice, I now have negative equity, right? Because assets are equal to liabilities plus equity. Well, if my assets are 500 and my liabilities are 700, then what is my equity?
Well, my equity's going to be minus 200. So essentially I'm broke. This bank is out of business.
And that's what leverage is a measure of, because if you have really high leverage, then you-- notice, when we had no leverage, you could take a 50% loss really easy, but now that we had even 10:3 leverage, even a 50% loss wiped us out. And if you had 10:1 leverage, then even a 10% loss would wipe you out. So leverage really is a measure of how much cushion do you have to take losses in the future.
Anyway, before I run out of time-- and in the next video, I'll actually talk about how leverage is regulated within banks, but just to give you another measure of leverage-- because this measure I gave you-- if someone says 10:3 leverage, it's assets to equity-- another one that people often use, often in the investing world, is debt to equity.
Ladies and gentlemen, gather around. I would love to share with you a story. Once upon a time in 19th century Germany, there was the book.
Lothar Meggendorfer.
Lothar Meggendorfer put his foot down, and he said, "Genug ist genug!"
He grabbed his pen, he snatched his scissors. This man refused to fold to the conventions of normalcy and just decided to fold.
History would know Lothar Meggendorfer as -- who else? -- the world's first true inventor of the children's pop-up book. (Music) For this delight and for this wonder, people rejoiced.
Lothar Meggendorfer wasn't the first to evolve the way a story was told, and he certainly wasn't the last.
Whether storytellers realized it or not, they were channeling Meggendorfer's spirit when they moved opera to vaudville, radio news to radio theater, film to film in motion to film in sound, color, 3D, on VHS and on DVD. There seemed to be no cure for this Meggendorferitis. And things got a lot more fun when the Internet came around.
They realized that, in 6,000 years of storytelling, they've gone from depicting hunting on cave walls to depicting Shakespeare on Facebook walls. And this was a cause for celebration. The art of storytelling has remained unchanged.
Welcome to the presentation on multiplying expressions. Let's get started. So if I were to ask you what x plus two times, let me use a different color, times x plus three equals, at first you'd be like, huh, that's a little strange.
So that's minus tenx. And then nine times negative two, well, that's minus eighteen. And we're almost done.
Minus tenx. So that's plus twenty-sixx minus eighteen. There.
Let's do twox plus y. Whoops, some parentheses. I'll stay in one color, since I think you understand what we're doing.
Let's do twox plus two squared. Well, you might be temptd to just square each of these terms, but you've got to be careful because you have this x here. So it actually turns out that this is equal to twox plus two times twox plus two.
We're in the Musee de Louvre and we're looking at
Jacques-Louis David's "Brutus and his Sons". This is one of my favourite paintings by David and dates to the very year of the Revolution itself 1789. And it was tied beautifully to the revolutionary sentiment in subject.
Brutus has led the revolution against the kings in Rome, this is an Anient Rome.
Brutus has discovered that his sons have commited treason in attempting to restore the monarchy throne. So Brutus has judged, has taken the extraordinary step of sentencing his own family to death for their treason. Putting the state above his own personal family, above his own feelings, above his own needs.
Brutus sits in shadow, under a statue of Rome, holding his edict in his hand. His feet crossed beneath him, his hand up, he's obviously in thought, he is back turned to the body of his son to be seen being carried in behind him, while his wife and children who form the other half of the composition call out fully illuminated, shielding their eyes, passing out. They cant't believe what Brutus has done.
Brutus is quiet, he's calm, he's resigned, even if there's a kind of deep tragedy there, the woman on the other side and the children have given into their emotions. In many ways this fits in with ideas that were around during the Revolution that only men really have the capability of sacrificing for the state, of being true citizens because only men could rise above their emotions and their personal concerns to think about these greater goods. That stoicism seems to be echoed in a very architecure of this space.
Where the virtues that are expressed in this early painting by David are turned away from. In some tragic way this painting does for shadow, the collapse and failure of the Revolution.
We're asked to name an angle adjacent to angle BGD. So angle BGD, let's see if we can pick it out. So here is B, here is G, and here is D, right over here.
 Solve the equation: x squared minus x squared minus 4 over x minus 2 is equal to 4. And they tell us that x won't or cannot be 2 because if it was 2, then this would be undefined.
So if we were to rewrite it, this is equivalent to x squared minus-- instead of writing x squared minus 4, we know that's a difference of squares. That is x plus 2 times x minus 2. All of that over x minus 2.
And this whole time we're assuming that x won't be equal to 2.
And because x does not equal to 2, x minus 2 divided by x minus 2 is going to be defined. And it will be 1. So those two will cancel out.
We can distribute the negative sign, so we get x squared minus x minus 2 is equal to 4. And what we want to do is put this in the form ax squared plus bx plus c is equal to 0. That allows us to either factor it or apply the quadratic equation or complete the square, or any of the ways that we know how to solve quadratics.
Let me write it up here. x squared minus x minus 6 is equal to 0. And this looks factorable. We just have to think of two numbers that when we multiply them give us negative 6.
Either x minus 3 is equal to 0 or x plus 2 is equal to 0. And then if we take x minus 3 is equal to 0, if we add 3 to both sides of that equation, we get x is equal to 3 or, if we subtract 2 from both sides of this equation, we get x is equal to negative 2.
So both of these are solutions. And let's apply them into this equation to make sure that they work. Because these are solutions to essentially, the situation where we got rid of the x minus 2.
Sorry, 3 squared minus 4 over 3 minus 2. So this is equal to 9 minus-- 3 squared is 9 --minus 4, which is 5, over 1. So 9 minus 5, which is equal to 4.
All of that over negative 2 minus negative 2 over negative 4. Well 4 minus 4 is 0, so this whole thing is just going to become 0. So this whole thing is going to equal 4.
So that's why it makes sense that both of these solutions work.
We're asked to solve the equation "three plus the principle square root of five x plus six is equal to twelve" And so the general strategy to solve this type of equation, is to isolate the radical sign on one side of the equation, and then you can square it to essentially get the radical sign to go away.
But you have to be very careful there, because when you square radical signs you actually lose the information that you were taking the principle square root, not the negative square root or not the plus-or-minus square root. You're only taking the positive square root. And so when we get our final answer, we do have to check and make sure it gels with taking the principle square root.
Write the equation of a line that is parallel to the line 2x - 4y = 8 and goes through the point (3,0). So because this line is parallel to this right over here. it is parallel, that just means that it has the exact same slope. So we're essentially saying find the equation of a line that has the same slope as this line and goes through this point.
-4y = -2x + 8
And I'm writing the -2x first just because that gets us closer to the mx + b form. Now we can divide both sides of this equation by -4 so we can isolate the y. So we divide everything by -4. and the left-hand side, we just have a y is equal to (a -2 divided by -4 is 1/2) so y is equal to 1/2x (and then 8 divided by -4 is -2) so we could write plus -2 or we could just write minus 2.
And so this line over here, it's y intercept is at -3/2 and -3/2 is the same thing as -1 1/2, so it's going to be right above it and it has the exact same slope, so it's going to be right above it and so it would look like that. They're parallel but they're different lines because they have different y intercepts.
 Determine whether 30/45 and 54/81 are equivalent fractions. Well, the easiest way I can think of doing this is to put both of these fractions into lowest possible terms, and then if they're the same fraction, then they're equivalent.
We're told to factor 4x to the fourth y, minus 8x to the third y, minus 2x squared.
So to factor this, we need to figure out what the greatest common factor of each of these terms are. So let me rewrite it. So we have 4x to the fourth y, and we have minus 8x to the third y, and then we have minus 2x squared.
What I want to do in this video is show you a very cool video, then pose a question. But I want to make sure that everything is up and up, in terms of the copyright laws.
So the video I want to show you is from the show called the fifth gear, that appears on channel 5, I believe in the United Kingdom.
I think I'm okay on good copyright grounds to claim fair use here, because obviously the point of this is I'm going to ask a math question about the vide were going to see and so fair use
laws the purpose and character of use including whether such a commercial nature or non profit educational purposes we're definitely the later non profit educational purposes we are actually we aren't trying to in any way replace the work being used I'm just going to show a little snippet of it so we can use it as the basis for a problem this is kinda the meat of fair use law the viewer may fairly cite from the original work if it is design if his design be really and truly to use the passages for the purposes for fair and reasonable criticism in this case it's fair and reasonable math problem or physics problem on the other hand it is as clear he thus cites the most important parts of the work. with the view not to criticize but to supercede the the use of the original work and substitute the review for it such a use will be deemed in law a piracy so in no way do I want to supersede it. You should go look it up, go watch the show. this is not good enough
I don't even have the sound on it's going to be a small window over here where I'm just going to show this really really the part where they actually do a loop de loop. now with that out of the way this is where you can find more about fifth gear which is on channel 5 so now let me show you the video I'm going to have the sound down and so this is the video over here this is a pretty neat video this guy is going to try to do a loop de loop and he's actually going to succeed at doing the loop de loop and what I want you to do, the question I want to pose is look at this video and get a stop watch out or whatever else you need out a ruler whatever else you might need to do and try to figure out what we're going to try to figure out two things we're going to find out the minimum velocity the car needs to do the
loop de loop and we're also going to try to figure out what his actual velocity was over the course of the loop de loop so let's actually just watch this video so there he goes he's starting he's accelerating it looks like he's just crossed he's pushing almost forty miles an hour at least I'm assuming that's miles per hour this is a British show and then he hits the loop de loop and then he finishes it and he's done so let's think about for the next video
let's think about if we can figure out what the minimum what the minimum velocity or i should say the magnitude of the velocity or the speed had to be to actually complete the loop right over here and then we can actually get a stopwatch later on to see what his actall velocity was
what I want to do in this video is make it clear the distinction between an I-terative, or I should say iterative,
I always pronounce it wrong iterative function definition and a recursive function definition
We'll do it really by... Just kinda understanding where the iteration is happening over here and where the recursion is happening here on the right. So when we start off we see that product is set to be equal to 1 and then we enter our for loop and the for loop really is the meat of this iterative function definition.
let's say this is the result of a call of factorial of 3. So the argument that we passed this factorial is 3 so the variable number will refer to 3. So when you call range of number it will literally return a list:
And so each loop through this for loop i is going to be assigned to each successive element in this list. So on the first time through this for loop i is going to be assigned to 0. So our i is going to refer to 0.
'cos that was the only stuff that was indented within this for loop and then so we go back up and we are going to iterate through the next iteration of our loop. I guess you could say and now i is going to be assigned to 1. So now i is going to be 1.
Or the variable product, what it's referring to and that's what I should really say. We should return the value that the product is referring to and that value is 6. So when you call factorial 3 it will return 6.
In this situation the number is now 2 and we are gonna want to multiply that times the factorial... times the factorial of 2 minus 1. Well 2 minus 1 is just 1. Times the factorial of 1.
I want to talk about direct and inverse variations I'll do direct variations on the left over here And I'll do inverse variations or two variables that vary inversly on the right hand side over here
So a very simple definition for two variables that vary directly would be something like this Y varies directly with X if y is equal to some constant with x we could rewrite this in kind of english y varies directly with x if this constant seems strange to you remember this could be literally any constant number so let me give a bunch of examples that would also or particular examples of y varies directly with x you cold have Y is equal to X because of the situation the constant is 1, we didn't even write it you could have write Y is equal to 1X, then K is 1 we could write Y is equal to 2X we could write Y is equal to one half X we could write Y is equal to negative 2X we are still variating directly we could write Y is equal to negative one half X we could have Y is equal to π times X we could have Y is equal to negative π times X You get the point
let's explore inverse variation inverse variation the general form (if we use the same variables) it always doesn't have to be Y and X, it could be A and a B it could be a M and an N now to inverse varitaion, so if I did it with Ys and Xs this would be Y is equal to some constant (K) times 1/X so instead of being some constant times X, it's some constant times 1/X so let me show you a bunch of examples it could be Y is equal to 1/X it could be Y is equal to 2 times 1/X which is clearly the same thing as 2/X it could be Y is equal to 1/3 times 1/X whis is the same thing as 1/3X it could be Y is equal to -2/X and let's explore this, the inverse variation the same way we explain the direct variation so let's pick Y is equal to 2/X and let me do that same table over here if X is 1, then Y is 2 if X is 2 then 2 divided by 2 is 1 so if you multiply X by 2 you scale it up by a factor of 2, what happens to Y? Y gets scaled down by a factor of 2 you divide it by 2 now notice the difference? here however we scale X, we sacled up Y by the same amount now if we scale up X by a factor when we have inverse variation, we are scaling down Y by the same so that's were the inverse is coming from and we could go the other way id we made X is equal to 1/2 so if we were to scale down X, we are going to see that this is going to scale up Y
'cause 2 divided by 1/2 is 4 so here we are scaling up Y so they are going to do the opposite things they vary inverse, and you could try it with the negative way of it as well so here we are multiplying by 2 and once again it is not always neatly written for you like this it could be rearranged in a bunch different ways but it will still be inverse variation as long as they are algebraically equivalent so you could multiply both side of this equation right here by X and you would get XY is equal to 2, this is also inverse variation you would get this exact same table over here you could divide both sides of this equation by Y and you could X is equal to 2/Y which is also the same thing as 2 times 1/Y so notice Y varies inversely with X and you could just manipulate this algebraically to show that X varies inversely with Y so Y varies inversely with X this is the same thing (as seen in this example) as saying that X varies inveresely with Y and there is other things we could take this and divide both sides by 2 and you would get Y/2 is equal to 1/X there's all sort of crazy things so in general if you see an expression that relates two variables and they say do they vary inversely or directly or maybe neither you could either try to make a table like this if you scale up X by certain amount and Y gets scaled up by the same amount that is direct variation if you scale up X, you may want to try it a couple of different times and you scale down Y, do the opposite with Y, then it is probably inverse variation a sure way to know what you're dealing with it's to actually algebraically manipulate the equation so it gets back to either this form that tells you it's inverse variation or this form, which will tell you that it is direct variation
Let's add these two mixed numbers two and five thirteenths plus seven and six thirteenths and the way I like to think about it in my head,
I like to separate out the mixed numbers in to the whole number component and the fractional component so we can rewrite two and five thirteenths as, two plus five over thirteen and then, we can write that plus, then seven and six thirteenths we can rewrite as plus seven plus six thirteenths
so all I did is I rewrote this and essentially expanded out, I broke up the mixed numbers in to their whole number parts and their fractional parts and then what I like to do is I like to add the whole number parts so this two plus this seven, so I'll do the two plus seven over here...
I'll add those up, and to that I will add the fractional parts so to that, I will add the five thirteenths to the six thirteenths so if we add the whole number parts two plus seven is nine and the fractional parts, already having the same denominator five thirteenths plus six thirteenths your going to get eleven thirteenths, five plus six is eleven so you get nine plus eleven thirteenths well that's just the same thing as nine and eleven thirteenths and we are done!
Let's see if we can write 0.15 as a fraction. So the important thing here is to look at what place these digits are in. So this 1 right over here, this is in the tenths place.
The decorative use of wire in southern Africa dates back hundreds of years. But modernization actually brought communication and a whole new material, in the form of telephone wire. Rural to urban migration meant that newfound industrial materials started to replace hard-to-come-by natural grasses.
And we supply the Conran shops, and Donna Karan, and so it's kind of great. This is our group, our main group of weavers. They come on a weekly basis to Durban.
Let's say the United States economy is going into a recession, or maybe even worse than a recession, and you are the chairman of the Federal Reserve and you need to do something about it. Well the first thing that you would do is that you would lower the Federal Funds Rate, and that's the rate that banks lend to each other overnight and the way that you lower it, if the banks don't do it on their own after you say you want to lower it is that you print money, as the Federal Reserve and you use it to buy, usually short-term treasury securities and that money gets deposited in banks, so the demand for reserves, because that's what these things are the demand for reserves goes down, and the supply goes up and the federal funds rate should go down.
And in Bernanke's mind, although that's exactly what he's doing he's printing money to buy other things than what the Fed traditionally does, when it cares about the overnight borrowing rate, he calls it, not necessarily quantitative easing, but credit easing, and in his mind, even though mechanically they're the same thing, in his mind, he's saying, "Look, I'm printing this money "...not just for the sake of printing the money,
"...and putting it into circulation,
"...I'm printing the money so that I can buy particular assets,
"...where it seems like there might be a log jam in the credit market" because with just printing money and buying government securities maybe the interest rates on government debt goes down but maybe because of panic or crisis, interest or the prices on these things don't behave properly. So in order to fix that credit easing, in Bernanke's sense, would be to go out and buy this type of asset.
My name is Cameron Russell, and for the last little while, I've been a model.
I always just say, "Oh, I was scouted," but that means nothing. The real way that I became a model is I won a genetic lottery, and I am the recipient of a legacy, and maybe you're wondering what is a legacy. Well, for the past few centuries we have defined beauty not just as health and youth and symmetry that we're biologically programmed to admire, but also as tall, slender figures, and femininity and white skin.
"Wait. Naomi.
Tyra.
Joan Smalls.
Liu Wen." And first, I commend you on your model knowledge. Very impressive.
"Can I be a model when I grow up?" And the first answer is, "I don't know, they don't put me in charge of that." But the second answer, and what I really want to say to these little girls is,
"Why? You know? You can be anything.
"No, no, Cameron, I want to be a model," well, then I say, "Be my boss." Because I'm not in charge of anything, and you could be the editor in chief of American Vogue or the CEO of H&amp;M, or the next Steven Meisel. Saying that you want to be a model when you grow up is akin to saying that you want to win the Powerball when you grow up.
"Do you get free stuff?" (Laughter) I do have too many 8-inch heels which I never get to wear, except for earlier, but the free stuff that I get is the free stuff that I get in real life, and that's what we don't like to talk about.
And there are only 177,000 young black and Latino men in New York, so for them, it's not a question of, "Will I get stopped?" but "How many times will I get stopped? When will I get stopped?" When I was researching this talk,
"What is it like to be a model?" And I think the answer that they're looking for is,
"If you are a little bit skinnier and you have shinier hair, you will be so happy and fabulous." And when we're backstage, we give an answer that maybe makes it seem like that.
We say, "It's really amazing to travel, and it's amazing to get to work with creative, inspired, passionate people." And those things are true, but they're only one half of the story, because the thing that we never say on camera, that I have never said on camera, is,
"I am insecure." And I'm insecure because I have to think about what I look like every day. And if you ever are wondering,
"If I have thinner thighs and shinier hair, will I be happier?" you just need to meet a group of models, because they have the thinnest thighs, the shiniest hair and the coolest clothes, and they're the most physically insecure women probably on the planet. When I was writing this talk, I found it very difficult to strike an honest balance, because on the one hand,
Thought I would do a video on Communism, just because I've been talking about it a bunch in the history videos, and I haven't given you a good definition of what it means or a good understanding of what it means. To understand Communism, let me just draw you a spectrum here.
The modern versions of Communism are really kind of the brainchild of Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin.
Karl Marx was a German philosopher in the 1800's who in his communist manifesto and other writings, kind of created the philosophical underpinnings for Communism.
And Vladimir Lenin who led the Bolshevik revolution and created essentially the Soviet Union. He's the first person to make some of Karl Marx's ideas more concrete. And really every nation or every country which we view as communist has really followed the pattern of Vladimir Lenin.
We'll talk about that in a second. First let's talk about the philosophical differences between these things and how you would move.
Karl Marx himself viewed Communism as kind of a progression from Capitalism through Socialism to Communism. So, what he saw in Capitalism and at least this part of what he saw was right You have private property, private ownership of land.
And from Karl Marx's point of view, he said look, if all of these labourers who don't have as much capital, this guy has this capital. And so he can make these labourers work for a very small wage. And so any excess profits that come out from this arrangement, the owner of the capital will be able to get it, because these labourers won't be able to get their wages to go up, because there's so much competition for them to work on this guy's farm or to work on this guy's land.
Mark Twain called it the gilded age. These industrialists who did accumulate huge amounts of capital they really did have a lot of the leverage relative to the laborers.
And so Karl Marx says, look, if the guy with all the capital has all the leverage and this whole arrangement makes some profits, he is going to be able to keep the profits because he can keep all of these dudes' wages low. So what is going to happen is the guy with the capital is just going to end up with more capital.
So, in Karl Marx's point of view, the natural progression would be for these people to start organizing. So these people maybe start organizing into unions. So they could collectively tell the person who owns the land or the factory
"no, we're not going to work" or
"we're going to go on strikes unless you increase our wages" or "unless you give us better working conditions". So when you start talking about this unionization stuff, you're starting to move into the direction of Socialism.
The other element of moving in the direction of Socialism is that Karl Marx didn't like this kind of high concentration. Socialists in general I should say, didn't like this high concentration of wealth, that you have this reality of, not only do you have these people who could accumulate all of this wealth and maybe to some degree they're able to accumulate it because they were innovative or they were good managers of land, or whatever. Although the Marxists don't give a lot of credit to the owners of capital, they don't give a lot of credit to them.
What is the average rate of change of y(x) over the interval -5 &lt; x &lt; -2? So this is x = -5. When x = -5, y(x) = 6.
So our average rate of change of y(x) over the interval from -5 to -2 is -2. Every time, on average, x increased by 1, y [changed] by -2.
Microorganisms are small. So small you can't even see them unless they cluster together. Each of these dots is really millions of bacteria.
Legend has it that in Fleming's original experiment, some mold from his lunch sandwich accidentally dropped into his petri dish. Let's take a closer look, and we'll come back later and see what's changed. Under a microscope mold looks something like this yellow model, and mold attacks bacteria cell walls, represented by these cups.
Mold secretes a chemical: penicillin, which damages bacteria cell walls, stamping out the competition. This means the bacteria surrounding the mold will die. We're looking for bacterial death around the mold.
Alexander Fleming, after treating wounded soldiers in World War One, was the first person to realize how useful antibiotics are for treating infection. Today we remember him for his discovery of penicillin. I think his experiment is really neat, and I hope you do, too.
It's great being here at TED. You know, I think there might be some presentations that will go over my head, but the most amazing concepts are the ones that go right under my feet. The little things in life, sometimes that we forget about,
"What motivates the pollinators?" Well, their answer was,
"It's all about risk and reward." Like a wide-eyed kid, I'd say, "Why is that?" And they'd say, "Well, because they want to survive."
"Well, why?" And I thought that they'd probably say, "Well, it's all about sex."
And Chip Taylor, our monarch butterfly expert, he replied, "Nothing lasts forever. Everything in the universe wears out." And that blew my mind.
(Applause) Thank you. Thank you very much.
Now, if President Obama invited me to be the next Czar of Mathematics, then I would have a suggestion for him that I think would vastly improve the mathematics education in this country. And it would be easy to implement and inexpensive. The mathematics curriculum that we have is based on a foundation of arithmetic and algebra.
What I want to do in this video is talk a little bit about money and interest rates and do it in kind of a microeconomic framework, so that we understand the relationship between the supply of money and demand for money and the price of money, which we'll see is what interest rates actually are.
Here are the answers. Breadth-first search, as the name implies, expands nodes in this order. One, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
Let's define some sets.
Let's say the set A is composed of the numbers 1, 3, 5, 7 and 18
Let's say the set B is composed of 1, 7, and 18 and let's say that the set C is composed of 18, 7, 1, and 19.
What I want to start thinking about in this video is the notion of a subset. The first question is: Is B a subset of A?
B is a subset of A. B is a subset, let me write that down.
B is subset of A.
Every element of B is a member of A.
We can go even further and say B is a "strict" subset of A because B is a subset of A, but it does not equal A which means that there are things in A that are not in B. So we could go even further and say that B is a strict, or sometimes a "proper" subset of A. You can almost imagine that this is a less than or equal sign, and then you cross out the equal part of the sign.
So this means a strict subset which means that everything that is in B is a member of A, but everything that is in A is not a member of B.
B is a strict subset or proper subset. For example, we can write that A is a subset of A. In fact, every set is a subset of itself because everyone of its members is a member of A.
We cannot write that A is a strict subset of A. This right over here is false. Let's give ourselves a little bit more practice.
Can we write that B is a subset of C?
Let's see. C contains 1, 7, 18, so every member of B is indeed a member of C so this right here is true.
Can we write that C is a subset of A? Every element of C needs to be in A.
A has 18, 7, 1, but it does not have 19, so once again, this is false.
We could write that B is a subset of C, or we could even write that B is a strict subset of C. We can also reverse the way we write this, and then we're really just talking about supersets.
We could reverse this notation and say that A is a superset of B.
This is just another way of saying that B is a subset of A. The way you can think about this is A contains every element that is in B.
It might contain more or it might contain every element.
You can view this as the equal symbol if this was greater or equal to (≥) they're not quite exactly the same thing but we know already that we can also write that A is a strict superset of B which means that A everything that B has, and then some.
A is not equivalent to B. So hopefully this familiarizes you with the notions of subsets and supersets and strict subsets.
We're asked to shade 20% of the square below. Before doing that, let's just even think about what percent means. Let me just rewrite it.
And if you're familiar with the word century, you might already know that cent comes from the Latin for the word hundred.
This literally means you can take cent, and that literally means 100. So this is the same thing as 20 per 100. 20% means you're really going to meet
I, like many of you, am one of the two billion people on Earth who live in cities. And there are days -- I don't know about the rest of you -- but there are days when I palpably feel how much I rely on other people for pretty much everything in my life. And some days, that can even be a little scary.
I read an article by New York Times writer Michael Pollan, in which he argued that growing even some of our own food is one of the best things that we can do for the environment.
Now at the time that I was reading this, it was the middle of the winter and I definitely did not have room for a lot of dirt in my New York City apartment. So I was basically just willing to settle for just reading the next Wired magazine and finding out how the experts were going to figure out how to solve all these problems for us in the future.
But that was actually exactly the point that Michael Pollan was making in this article -- it's precisely when we hand over the responsibility for all these things to specialists that we cause the kind of messes that we see with the food system.
So, I happen to know a little bit from my own work about how NASA has been using hydroponics to explore growing food in space. And that you can actually get optimal nutritional yield by running a kind of high-quality liquid soil over plants' root systems. Now to a vegetable plant, my apartment has got to be about as foreign as outer space.
The first few systems that we created, they kind of worked. We were actually able to grow about a salad a week in a typical New York City apartment window. And we were able to grow cherry tomatoes and cucumbers, all kinds of stuff.
But the first few systems were these leaky, loud power-guzzlers that Martha Stewart would definitely never have approved. (Laughter) So to bring on more codevelopers, what we did was we created a social media site on which we published the designs, we explained how they worked, and we even went so far as to point out everything that was wrong with these systems.
What we're doing is what NASA or a large corporation would call R&amp;D, or research and development.
But what we call it is R&amp;D-I-Y, or "research and develop it yourself." (Laughter)
So, for example, Jackson came along and suggested that we use air pumps instead of water pumps. It took building a whole bunch of systems to get it right, but once we did, we were able to cut our carbon footprint nearly in half.
Tony in Chicago has been taking on growing experiments, like lots of other window farmers, and he's been able to get his strawberries to fruit for nine months of the year in low-light conditions by simply changing out the organic nutrients.
And window farmers in Finland have been customizing their window farms for the dark days of the Finnish winters by outfitting them with LED grow lights that they're now making open source and part of the project.
So window farms have been evolving through a rapid versioning process similar to software. And with every open source project, the real benefit is the interplay between the specific concerns of people customizing their systems for their own particular concerns, and the universal concerns. So my core team and I are able to concentrate on the improvements that really benefit everyone.
But I think that Eleen expresses best what we really get out of this, which is the actual joy of collaboration. So she expresses here what it's like to see someone halfway across the world having taken your idea, built upon it and then acknowledging you for contributing. If we really want to see the kind of wide consumer behavior change that we're all talking about as environmentalists and food people, maybe we just need to ditch the term "consumer" and get behind the people who are doing stuff.
So, if you watched the presentation on the center of mass, which you should have, you might have gotten a little bit of a glancing view of what torque is. And now we'll do some more in detail. So in general, from the center of mass video, we learned, if this is a ruler and this is the ruler's center of mass.
And torque, the letter for torque is this Greek, I think that's tau, it's a curvy T. And torque is defined as force times distance. And what force and what distance is it?
So what's this torque? So let's call this f. This is the force.
If we follow the units all the way through, we would get that f is equal to 10 newtons. So that's interesting. I applied double the force at half the distance.
It was pointed out in the comments for the last video where I defined this insertion sort that I didn't necessarily have to do this break, the logic, and this is one of those examples that sometimes when you just program something and the way that your brain is at least thinking about it you don't always do it in maybe the most elegant way and that commenter was right.
There was a slightly more, or a lot more elegant way to do this insertion sort. So, over here if we go into the WHlLE loop,
I have this WHlLE loop happening WHlLE I is greater than or equal to zero But then, I want to essentially BREAK out of that WHlLE loop if the variable value is not less than the I-th element in list So, one way to do this, cause I'm just defining the parameters on when to do this WHlLE loop.
I can auto take all of these one level back and then I don't have to do an ELSE and I don't have to BREAK out of the loop anymore so that should simplify the program a good bit. But, let's verify for ourselves that this actually works, so let me save it. And then
let me run it, looks like its...let me define a list, so let me call it, I'll just call it C is equal to one, five, six, seven two, four, fourteen and two. So let's just define that and let's try our insertion sort.
Insertion sort on C, let's see what we get.
So let's see, let's print C now and there you go. It sorted it. So thank you for the comment.
I think this does simplify it a little bit and it shows that sometimes you always have to question especially if you have a WHlLE statement, is there a better way instead of using a BREAK because I'm putting a condition on a reason to BREAK out of the WHlLE loop, why don't I implicitly just put it up here.
We're asked to solve the equation 2x squared plus 3 = 75. So in this situation looks like we might be able to isolate the x squared pretty simply. 'Cause there's only one term that involves an x here.
First, consider the expression for take the quantity of negative 4 times x and add 9. So let's see, we're going to take the quantity of negative 4 times x. Well, negative 4 times x is just going to be negative 4x.
Take the quantity of negative 4 times x and add 9. That's this expression right over here. Now select the answer that matches the following-- the sum of 4 and the product of negative 9 and that expression.
Narrator: I do want to clarify that the whole point that I'm showing these weaknesses in Fractional Reserve lending isn't to argue that it necessarily has to go away or that it is somehow unviable.
You've probably seen an email or an internet post about how weird and random English spelling seems to be. But what if I told you that it actually makes perfect sense? In fact, that's spelling's job:
A free-base element, like O-N-E, or T-W-O, can stand on its own as a word, like one, or two.
A bound base, like the R-U-P-T of "erupt" or "rupture" needs another element in order to surface in a word.
Two or more bases give us compounds, like "twofold" or "someone" or "bankrupt." Once we figure out a word's meaningful elements, We can peel back its history to shed a little more light on why it's spelled as it is.
The word "two," for example, needs its "W" in order to mark its connection to words like "twice," "twelve," "twenty,"
"twin" and "between." A word's history is another layer of the onion. With that understanding, let's investigate the word "one."
"One's" historical layers include its relatives
"only," "once," "eleven," and even "a," "an" and "any." But it's the morphological relatives - the ones that share the base O-N-E -
There are the familiar ones, like "anyone," and "one-track" and "oneself" - those are obvious. But let's take a look at some unexpected derivations of the word "one." The word "alone" is built from the prefix A-L plus the base O-N-E.
It's the same A-L prefix that we see in "always," "already," "almighty" and "almost."
It means "all." the word "alone" means "all one."
It was misanalysed in the middle ages as having the prefix "a," like in "asleep" and "awake" and "around," and a new base was born: L-O-N-E, which then developed into its own family.
In the word "atone," we find the familiar preposition "at" compounded with the base O-N-E. See, when we atone for something we've done wrong, we attempt to make things whole again, to fix what's broken, to be at one again with whomever we hurt. But here's perhaps the best one of all: the word "onion," which is also frequently derided as irregular or crazy, for its spelling of "uh" with an O.
When we look at the roots of an onion, we learn that it is written as O-N-E plus I-O-N, the same suffix we find in "tension," "action," "union" and thousands of other words in English. Unlike the many cloves in a head of garlic, an onion has a single bulb. It is marked by the state or condition of oneness.
Let's say we have some object that's moving in a circular path Let's say this is the center of the object path, the center of the circle So the object is moving in a circular path that looks something like that counterclockwise circular path--you could do that with clockwise as well
Remember radians is just one way to measure angles You could do with how degrees per second If we do it with radians, we know that each revolution is 2 pi radians
You're going 1 2 3 4 5, so that gives us 10, or 2 pi 2 pi 2 pi 2 pi 2 pi radians every time, you're doing it five times a second. So you're doing it 10 pi radians per second
So this right here, either five revs per second or 10 pi radians per second they're both essentially measuring the same thing how fast are you orbiting around this central point?
And this measure of how fast you're orbiting around a central point is called angular velocity It's called angular velocity because if you think about it this is telling us how fast is our angle changing, or speed of angle changing When you're dealing with it in two dimensions and this is typically when in a recent early physics course how we do deal with it
You could say angular velocity is equal to change in angle over a change in time So for example, this is telling us 10 pi radians per second
Or if you want to do in the calculus sense and take instantaneous angular velocity it would be the derivative of your angle with respect to time
How the angle is changing with respect to time With that out of the way, I want to see if we can see how this relates to speed How does this relate to the actual speed of the object?
We have one revolution is equal to 2 pi radians Just to be clear, sometimes angular velocity is actually measured in revolutions per second but the SI unit is in radians per second So here I want to convert omega from radians per second into revolutions per second
And if this was a vector, I would put an arrow over there then I'll be referring to the thing that's popping out of the page but here I'm talking about the magnitude of the angular velocity and so writing in words, you get speed is equal to angular velocity-- if you want to be particular, this is the magnitude of the angular velocity-- times the radius of the circle that you are going around and if you want to solve for angular velocity you divide both sides by radius and you get angular velocity Omega is equal to speed which we're using v for, divided by the radius So we can actually use this information to do other interesting things later on
Let's now account for the same series of events but instead of doing it on a cash basis let's do it on an accrual basis. And the whole idea with accrual accounting, is to match your revenues and expenses to when you actually perform the service, so it actual captures a business activity, as opposed to just capturing when cash changes hands.
Now, with cash basis, you would have added that to your revenue, but here, we already accounted for it in the accounts receivable, we already took that revenue. But because you've got the $400 in cash, it's going to disappear from receivables, and then go into cash, cause you actually got it. You get $400 from the customer in the previous month.
In the last video, we talked about how the Serbians were able to hold back the Austro-Hungarians at the beginning of World War I. But eventually they had to give in. They were essentially -
Anna wants to celebrate her birthday by eating pizza with her friends. p boxes of pizza cost $40 total. Each box of pizza costs $8. Select all equations that describe this situation.
In this talk, I'm going to give you the single most important lesson my colleagues and I have learned from looking at 83,000 brain scans. But first, let me put the lesson into context. I am in the middle of seven children.
As our professors used to say: "How do you know, unless you look?" In 1979, when I was a second-year medical student, someone in my family became seriously suicidal, and I took her to see a wonderful psychiatrist.
In 1991, I went to my first lecture on brain SPECT imaging.
SPECT is a nuclear medicine study that looks at the blood flow and activity, it looks at how your brain works. SPECT was presented as a tool to help psychiatrists get more information to help their patients. In that one lecture, my two professional loves, medical imaging and psychiatry, came together, and quite honestly, revolutionized my life.
SPECT basically tells us three things about the brain: good activity, too little, or too much. Here's a set of healthy SPECT scans. The image on the left shows the outside surface of the brain, and a healthy scan shows full, even, symmetrical activity.
Here's a scan of a traumatic brain injury. Your brain is soft, and your skull is really hard. Or drug abuse.
In 1992, I went to an all-day conference on brain SPECT imaging, it was amazing and mirrored our own early experience using SPECT in psychiatry. But at that same meeting, researchers started to complain loudly that clinical psychiatrists like me should not be doing scans, that they were only for their research. Being the maverick and having clinical experience,
Early on, our imaging work taught us many important lessons, such as illnesses, like ADHD, anxiety, depression, and addictions, are not simple or single disorders in the brain, they all have multiple types. For example, here are two patients who have been diagnosed with major depression, that had virtually the same symptoms, yet radically different brains. One had really low activity in the brain, the other one had really high activity.
Researchers have found that undiagnosed brain injuries are a major cause of homelessness, drug and alcohol abuse, depression, panic attacks, ADHD, and suicide. We are in for a pending disaster with the hundreds and thousands of soldiers coming back from Iraq and Afganistan, and virtually no one is looking at the function of their brain. As we continued our work with SPECT, the criticism grew louder, but so did the lessons.
Dostoyevsky once said: "A society should be judged not by how well it treats its outstanding citizens, but by how it treats its criminals." Instead of just crime and punishment, we should be thinking about crime evaluation and treatment.
So after 22 years and 83,000 scans, the single most important lesson my colleagues and I have learned is that you can literally change people's brains. And when you do, you change their life. You are not stuck with the brain you have, you can make it better, and we can prove it.
My colleagues and I performed the first and largest study on active and retired NFL players, showing high levels of damage in these players at the time when the NFL said they didn't know if playing football caused long-term brain damage. The fact was they didn't want to know. That was not a surprise.
"Probably a bad idea for your life." (Laughter) But what really got us excited was the second part of the study where we put players on a brain-smart program and demonstrated that 80% of them could improve in the areas of blood flow, memory, and mood, that you are not stuck with the brain you have, you can make it better on a brain-smart program.
Here is this scan of a teenage girl who has ADHD, who was cutting herself, failing in school, and fighting with her parents. When we improved her brain, she went from D's and F's to A's and B's, and was much more emotionally stable.
Here is the scan of Nancy.
Nancy had been diagnosed with dementia, and her doctor told her husband that he should find a home for her because within a year, she would not know his name. But on an intensive, brain-rehabilitation program,
Nancy's brain was better, as was her memory, and four years later, Nancy still knows her husband's name. Or my favorite story to illustrate this point: Andrew, a 9-year-old boy who attacked a little girl on the baseball field for no particular reason, and at the time, was drawing pictures of himself hanging from a tree and shooting other children.
Andrew was Columbine, Aurora, and Sandy Hook waiting to happen. Most psychiatrists would have medicated Andrew, as they did Eric Harris and the other mass shooters before they committed their awful crimes, but SPECT imaging taught me that I had to look at his brain and not throw darts in the dark at him to understand what he needed. His SPECT scan showed a cyst, the size of a golf ball, occupying the space of his left temple lobe.
In most topics you have to get pretty advanced before you start addressing the philosophically interesting things, but in chemistry it just starts right from the get-go with what's arguably the most philosophically interesting part of the whole topic, and that's the atom. And the idea of the atom, as philosophers long ago, and you could look it up on the different philosophers who first philosophized about it, they said, hey, you know, if I started off with, I don't know, if I started off with an apple if I started of with a apple and I just kept cutting the apple -- let me draw a nice looking apple just so it doesn't look just like a heart .
How do we know what it is? Well if we haven't memorized it, we could look it up on the periodic table of elements, which we'll be dealing with a And you'd say, oh, four protons, that is beryilium.
So in this case we have six protons, so we must also have six neutrons. Six neutrons plus six protons. Now, where are the electrons?
Now, what does that mean? Does that mean that carbon has six protons and then the remainder, the remaining 6.0107 neutrons, it has kind of this fraction of a neutron? No.
It's 1/100,000. So if you had-- let's say you had liquid helium, which you'd have to get very cold to get. If you're looking at that, most of it is free space.
A single postage stamp costs $0.44. How much would a roll of 1000 stamps cost? And there is really a couple of ways to do it, and I'll do it both ways just to show you they both work.
I want to address the issue of compassion. Compassion has many faces. Some of them are fierce; some of them are wrathful; some of them are tender; some of them are wise.
A line that the Dalai Lama once said, he said, "Love and compassion are necessities.
They are not luxuries. Without them, humanity cannot survive." And I would suggest, it is not only humanity that won't survive, but it is all species on the planet, as we've heard today.
"What is the most wondrous thing in the world, Yudhisthira?" And Yudhisthira replied,
"The most wondrous thing in the world is that all around us people can be dying and we don't realize it can happen to us."
I looked up. Tending those 31 dying people were young women from villages around Bangalore. I looked into the face of one of these women, and I saw in her face the strength that arises when natural compassion is really present.
And on the first day at Simikot in Humla, far west of Nepal, the most impoverished region of Nepal, an old man came in clutching a bundle of rags. And he walked in, and somebody said something to him, we realized he was deaf, and we looked into the rags, and there was this pair of eyes. The rags were unwrapped from a little girl whose body was massively burned.
Again, the eyes and hands of Avalokiteshvara. It was the young women, the health aids, who cleaned the wounds of this baby and dressed the wounds. I know those hands and eyes; they touched me as well.
In Buddhism, we say, "it takes a strong back and a soft front." It takes tremendous strength of the back to uphold yourself in the midst of conditions. And that is the mental quality of equanimity.
And the archetype of this in Buddhism is Avalokiteshvara, Kuan-Yin. It's a female archetype: she who perceives the cries of suffering in the world. She stands with 10,000 arms, and in every hand, there is an instrument of liberation, and in the palm of every hand, there are eyes, and these are the eyes of wisdom.
Jody Williams called it: It's good to meditate. I'm sorry, you've got to do a little bit of that, Jody.
Lets say we have one ray over here that starts at point A and then goes through point B, and so we could call this ray (we could call, let me draw that a little bit straighter) we could call this ray AB. Ray AB
starts at A or has a vertex at A and lets say that there is also a ray AC.
So lets say that C is sitting right over there and then i can draw another ray that goes through C, so this is ray AC. and what's interesting
about these two rays is that they have the exact same vertex. (they have the exact same vertex at A)
and in general what we have when we have two rays with the exact same vertex, you have an angle. and
you've probably, you're probably already reasonably familiar with the concept of an angle which i believe comes from the latin for corner, which makes sense this looks a little bit like a corner right over here that we see at point A and, but the geometric definition, or the one you are more likely to see
is when two rays share a common vertex. and that common vertex is actually called the vertex of the angle.
so A is vertex. Not only is it the vertex of each of these rays, ray AB and ray AC, it is also the vertex
of, of the angle. so the next thing i want to think about is how do we label, how do we label an angle
you might be tempted to just label it angle A, but i'll show you in a second why that's not going to
be so clear to someone based on where, where our angle is actually sitting. so the way that you specify an angle, and hopefully this will make sense in a second, is that you say ANGLE, (this is the symbol for angle) and it actually looks strangely similar to this angle right over here, but this little pointy thing almost looks like a less than sign, but it's not quite. its flat on the bottom right over here. this is the symbol for angle, you would say angle BAC, BAC, or you could say angle CAB, or angle CAB. and either case there kind of specifying this corner, or sometimes you could view it as this opening right over here. and the important thing to realize is that you have the vertex in the middle of the
When I was studying ancient Rome one of the most difficult things for me to understand is how all of these ancient ruins fit together, but luckily we have Dr. Bernard Frischer who has built an extraordinary video simulation that allows us to move through this space. The difficulty is always two-fold. First of all, that ancient cities are now in ruins so the one problem we have is how do you go from ruins to the way it did look in antiquity.
The Romans, as time went on in their history, said "where ever the emperor is, there the palace is," or the paletine. So, the term palace got detached from this physical hill and came to just mean "a place where the ruler lives". And actually as we're flying past what is the Circus Maximus,
The Colosseum. But we're in a fairly late moment in Roman history. Before the Colosseum, wasn't there another palace here?
The rotunda, the round part, we wouldn't really see in antiquity. We would see the part that has the eight columns across the front that looks like a traditional temple. We like to say that it was built as a building with a surprise on the inside.
Everything in human experience, and really human history or human civilizations experience, is that everything seems to fall to the earth, that if you have water particles, they don't just float up. If they are small enough they are being held up by the wind and all that, but if they are large enough, they will fall. That you don't have people that are able to just float around, they will fall.
You don't have taxi cabs that float around, they'll fall. Not only will the water fall, it will hit the ground, it will puddle up, and if there is a gutter it will fall into the gutter.
It is just trying to get lower and lower and lower. If i were to drop a bunch of needles they would just fall. If i had a needle at rest here it doesn't just automatically for no reason jump and fly upwards and start to float.
But for most purposes, when we're engineering things on the surface of the planet, and we are not going close to the speed of light, we can still use the mathematics that Isaac Newton came up with from this simple question. And not only was he able to kind of think that there's something... There's something that might be pulling, somehow, acting on this apple, bringing it to the earth.
And in it, he theorizes that the forces between objects now it's a vector quantity, it's always going to attract the two objects to each other. So the direction is towards each other. The force of gravity between two objects... is going to be equal to this this big G, which is really just a number, its a very small number.
Which is a super-duper small number, times the mass of the first object, times the mass of the second object, divided by the distance between the two objects.
So this is distance between two objects. So if you're talking about the force of gravity on Earth, this right over here... You pick one of the masses to be Earth, so this mass over here.
This G, this big G, this constant of proportionality, just to get a sense of how small it is... This is, and I'm going to round it here, it's approximately 6.67 times 10 to the negative 11th Newtons. And we'll talk about Newtons, it is the metric unit of force.
Let's learn a little bit about springs. So let's say I have a spring. Let me draw the ground so that we know what's going on with the spring.
It's along the floor. I'll use a thicker one, just to show it's a spring.
Let's say the spring looks something like this. Whoops, I'm still using the line tool. So the spring looks like this.
Let's say at this end it's attached to a wall. That's a wall. And so this is a spring when I don't have any force acting on it, this is just the natural state of the spring.
When I apply a force of 5 Newtons, the spring looks like this.
It compresses, right? We're all familiar with this. We sit on a bed every day or a sofa.
So my question is how much will it compress when I apply a 10-Newton force? So your intuition that it'll compress more is correct, but is it linear to how much I compress it? Is it a square of how much I compress it?
What will the spring look like? Well, it'll be more compressed. Drop my force to 10 Newtons.
That means that the restoring force of the spring is minus some number, times the displacement of the spring. So what does this mean? So in this example right here, what was the displacement of the spring?
So that's actually the force, the counteracting force, of the spring. That's what this formula gives us. So if this spring is stationary when I apply this 5-Newton force, that means that there must be another equal and opposite force that's positive 5 Newtons, right?
Newtons, so we can solve for K. We could say 5 is equal to 10K. Divide both sides by 10.
Well, if the spring is no longer accelerating in either direction, or the tip of the spring is no longer accelerating in either direction, we know that the restorative force must be counterbalancing this force that I'm compressing with, right?
The force that the spring wants to expand back with is 10 Newtons, positive 10 Newtons, right? And we know the spring constant, this K for this spring, for this material, whatever it might be, is 1/2. So we know the restorative force is equal to 1/2 times the distance, right?
So if the spring is stretched by 1 meter, out here, its restorative force will be 2 Newtons back this way, right? So its restorative force, this 2 Newtons, will equal minus K times how much I displaced it. Well I, displaced it by 1 meter, so then we multiply both sides by negative 1, and we get K is equal to minus 2.
And then I said, well, how much force would I have to apply to distort the spring by 2 meters? Well, it's 2 times 2, it would be 4. 4 Newtons to displace it by 2 meters, and, of course, the restorative force will then be in the opposite direction, and that's where we get the negative number.
What can be done with one voice? And when I say voice, I not only mean the actual sound that is being produced, but it's the message that is being delivered.

Hello, everyone. As you've been listening to everyone else's presentations and now to mine, I want you all to think about just how important language is.
The two most important parts of the brain associated with language are Wernicke's area and Broca's area.
Wernicke's area is mostly used for the understanding of language, while Broca's area is used mostly for speech formation.
Let's say you wanted to read something out loud. It would first come into your visual cortex, and then go to Wernicke's area, where you would understand the words you've just read. It would then go to Broca's area, where the words would be formed in your head in order for you to repeat them out loud.
But I never said she stole my money, could mean she stole my calculator instead. How is language developed in humans? Why do we say that younger children are more capable of learning language?
"How can we teach our son both Greek and English, so he's fluent in both languages and doesn't get confused between them?" The linguist said, "Whoever's better in Greek speaks only Greek, whoever in English, only English, so he sees them as two separate entities and could easily differentiate between them." Even until today, 20 years later,
As you can see in this University of California, San Diego study, a native Spanish speaker shows a lot more activity in the left side of their brain when speaking Spanish, but when asked to speak English, which in this case is secondary language, you see a lot more activity in the right side of the brain as well, as shown by those green arrows. As we can see in such an interdisciplinary and diversified world, just how important it might be to be bilingual. If we were able to promote this bilingual culture at younger ages, when learning languages is more efficient, it'd be more beneficial to society in the long run.
We finished off the last video entering into the Great Depression. It wasn't just a depression in the But I want to back up a little bit because I forgot to mention a very important fact that's hugely important to the rest of U.S. history in the 20th century and that's what happened in 1917 during World War I. And that's the Bolshevik Revolution.
June 6th 1944. If you've ever seen Saving Private Ryan it starts with this. I've never stormed a beach, but I can imagine that was probably the most realistic reenactment of what it was like to storm the beach at Normandy.
You have a situation where in Vietnam. You have Vietnam which is right about... In Vietnam you have the Communists come to power in North Vietnam (this was formerly a French colony).
When I first started, what was very very important to me Was dealing with the nature of process. So, what I had done was I had written a verb list--
Now, what happens when you do that is You don't become involved with the psychology of what you're making, Nor do you become involved with the after image of what it's going to look like.
I think what artists do is They invent strategies that allow themselves to see In a way that they haven't seen before
Cézanne did it in his way, Obviously, Pollock did it his way By dripping downward in a horizontal plane.
What I want to do in this video is show you a way of subtracting numbers that is different than the regrouping technique. And this is closer to what I actually do in my head. And this might not be what you see in school, so be careful while you're looking at this.
Tommy Mizzone: Tonight we're going to play you two songs.
We're three brothers from New Jersey, and the funny thing is that, believe it or not, we are hooked on bluegrass and we're excited to play it for you tonight. (Music) (Applause)
TM: Thank you, thank you. (Applause)
Robbie Mizzone: Thank you.
I'm Robbie Mizzone. I'm 13, and I play the fiddle. This is my brother, Jonny.

 Eric is selling raffle tickets for a school fundraiser. Each ticket costs $3, and he knows the amount of money he collects is a function of how many tickets he sells.
So it's a function of t, for tickets.
So m, the amount of money collected, is a function of the number of tickets he sells. That's a pretty straightforward function. Every ticket costs $3.
It sounds all fancy and difficult, but just remember the domain, this just means, what can I input into the function? So another way to think about is what are the possible t's that can be input into this function?
The range is, what are the possible values that the function can take on? So think about it. You might at first say I could put any t there, but think about the actual reality of what he's doing.
A range is the possible values that we can take on. If t is always going to be a non-negative integer, then what's 3t always going to be? Well it's going to be a non-negative multiple of 3.
I'm five years old, and I am very proud. My father has just built the best outhouse in our little village in Ukraine. Inside, it's a smelly, gaping hole in the ground, but outside, it's pearly white formica and it literally gleams in the sun.
The man at the front desk laughs, and he says, "You can't reserve a room here. This is a homeless shelter."
He had this shoebox that he carried with him everywhere containing nine comic books, two G.I. Joes painted to look like Spider-Man and five Gobots.
And this was his treasure. This was his own assembly of heroes that kept him from drugs and gangs and from giving up on his dreams. I'm going to tell you about one more formerly homeless member of our family.
This is Scarlett. Once upon a time, Scarlet was used as bait in dog fights. She was tied up and thrown into the ring for other dogs to attack so they'd get more aggressive before the fight.
Simplify x y to the -2 power, times 2 x-squared over y-squared to the 4th power So let's see what we can do over here So let's think about this part of our expression first, if I have x over y to the n-th power we know that this is the same thing as, x to the n over y to the n
"We hold these truths to be self-evident: That all men are created equal. That they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights.
SAL KHAN: Unalienable - this means can't be taken away. Its can live a rated you can't be can't be separated from you.
And yet Jefferson's writing this phrase when he owned slaves. The phrase life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness is also something that derives from John Locke. And these philosophers of the Enlightenment, they were writing in England.
My name is Marc Ecko. I am by nature, an artist. I came up at a time when there was a very unique window in popular culture.
Hip hop was emerging. There's an entrepreneurial virus that is hip hop, that rock and roll didn't quite have in the same way. There was a little more self-loathing amongst the rock set, in terms of the commercialization of their work.
Where in hip hop, it's been embraced to go create industry around your ideas. It's become a part of the ecosystem, because it's coming from nothing, right? And there's kind of this implied element of social justice, as well, in the business, born out of, like, what is hip hop and street culture.
Going from "I am consumer of X" to "I am maker of Y". That's an aspiration that is amongst all of us, but some of us, we just don't know how to do it. We kind of doubt ourselves.
You ask them &amp;quot;Who in this room is an artist?&amp;quot; Everybody raises their hand. You ask that same cohort, 20 years later, no one raises their hand.

Welcome to the second presentation on functions. So let's take off where we left off before. I still apologize -- in retrospect that that whole Sal food example.
Well maybe it was helpful, so I'm going to leave it there. Let's do some more problems. I think the best thing is to keep doing problems with you and I think you'll see the example, and hopefully you'll actually see that functions are kind of fun.
You can sit and think a little bit about what we just did while I erase.
So let's do another problem. What is f of h of 10? Well, first we want to figure out what h of 10 is, right?
And then f of 50 is, I think pretty straightforward at this point. You just take that 50 and replace it back here. Well, it's 50 squared plus 1.
That equals 2,501. What is g of h of 1? Well, we take h of 1, h of 1 is 5, so this is equal to g of 5.
PROBLEM: Construct a line perpendicular to the given line. So, if I can pick two arbitrary points on this line - and if I can make a line that is always equidistant from those two points, then that line will be perpendicular -
Let's see if we can divide 5.005 by-- let's divide it by 7, and see what we get. So we can rewrite this as 5.005 divided by 7. And the key here is to keep track of the decimal.
5 times 7 is 35. Subtract, and we are done. We have divided it completely.
Given the non-optimality of depth-first search, why would anybody choose to use it? Well, the answer has to do with the storage requirements. Here I've illustrated a state space consisting of a very large or even infinite binary tree.

How many ounces are in 6 pounds? So we have 6 pounds and we need to convert them to ounces. And if you don't know it already, you'll know it now, that there are 16 ounces per pound.
Simplify 3a times a to the fifth times a squared. So the exponent property we can use here is if we have the same base, in this case it's a, if we have it raised to the x power and we're multiplying it by a to the y power, then this is just going to be equal to a to the x plus y power, and we'll think about why that works in a second, so let's just apply it here, and let's start with the a to the fifth times a squared. So if we just apply this property over here, this will result in a to the five plus (2nd) power. so that's what those guys reduce to or simplify to and of course we still have, we still have the 3a out front.
In recent weeks, rising violence and fighting have taken the lives of innocent civillians- men, women and children. Heated rhetoric on both sides has raised the risk of war. So today I want to speak directly to you- the people of Sudan and
...and they tell us that p is greater than 7r. So, let's first think about the area of a rectangle with length p and width 2r. So, this is our rectangle right here... it has a length of p and it has a width of 2r.
Well, 4 times pi is going to get us something less than 14. This is less than 14, so this is 4 pi is less than 14. 14 is ... let me put it this way... 4 times 3.5 is equal to 14, right?
This r is the general term for any radius. They later told us that the actual radius is 2 times some letter r. So, I substitute that into the formula.
 Let's figure out how long this object is going to be in the air given that its vertical velocity, or the magnitude of the vertical velocity is s sine of theta.
So its speed in the vertical direction is s sine of theta. So how long is it going to be in the air? Well if I told you that something is going upwards at 10 meters per second and gravity is decelerating it at 10 meters per second squared.
So if this is 100 meters per second and if theta were-- I don't know-- let's say theta were 30 degrees, then sine of theta would be 1/2. So it'd be 100 meters per second times 1/2 divided by the acceleration of gravity times 2 would tell you exactly how long you would be in the air. How long it takes to go up all the way, become stationery, and then fall back down to the ground.
We humans have known for thousands of years, just looking at our environment around us, that there're different substances. These different substances...tend to have different properties. Not only do they have different properties; one might reflects light in a certain way, or not reflect light.
C stands for carbon -- I'm just going through the ones that are very relevant to humanity -- but over time you'll probably familiarize yourself with all of these. This is oxygen.
Evaluate the expression: 4n to the first power minus 2n to the zeroth power, for n equals 1 and n equals 5. So let's do n equals 1 first.
Simplify 16x plus 14 minus the entire expressions 3x squared plus x - 9. So when you subtract an entire expression, this is the exact same thing as having 16x + 14 and then your adding the opposite of this whole thing. Or you're adding negative 1 times 3x squared + x - 9.
Allison Hunt: My three minutes hasn't started yet, has it?
Chris Anderson: No, you can't start the three minutes. Reset the three minutes, that's just not fair.
AH: Oh my God, it's harsh up here. I mean I'm nervous enough as it is.
Now, in Canada, we have that great healthcare system. That means we get our new hips for free. And being the youngest of seven,
I wouldn't have my new hip for TEDGlobal in Africa.
I would not have my new hip for TED2008. I would still be on my bad hip. That was so disappointing.
"After you." "Oh, no, no. After you." Hey, are you from Canada?
"Great! Excellent!" So no, suddenly I wasn't averse to butting any geezer off the list.
So we have here it says: 2 times 4/3 = 8 times blank. I encourage you to pause the video right now and try to think about what should go in this blank.
The development and spread of railroads across the United States brought a wave of changes to American life. During the railroad boom, thousands of jobs were created, new towns were born, trade increased, transportation was faster, and the overall landscape of the nation transformed. But, perhaps the most interesting change of all is the least known: the establishment of standard time.
"Pardon me, sir. Do you have the time?"
"Why yes, which do you need?
It's 12:13 local time and 12:16 railway time." Ultimately, the logic of keeping a standard time prevailed, and the United States government made time zones a matter of law with the Standard Time Act of March 19, 1918. Since then, there have been numerous changes to the time zones, but the concept of standard time has remained.
Any pair of points can be connected by a line segment. That's right. Connect two pairs of black points in a way that creates two parallel line segments.
Rewrite the following expression as the product of positive exponents, and then evaluate the expression when x=2. So they give us x to the negative 3 times 5 to the negative 2 times x squared.
So the main thing to realize here is if I had something to a negative exponent, this is the exact same thing as 1 over that same base, to the positive version of the exponent. So x to the negative a is equal to 1 over x to the a. So using this knowledge just supply it over here.
So we can multiply this out and the numerator we have 1 times 1 times x squared. Which is just equal to x squared. And the denominator we have x to the third times 5 squared.
5 squared is 25, and here you could say implicit there is a 1. This is the same thing as x squared over 1. So the denominator we have 25 times x to the third.
Ladies and gentlemen, at TED we talk a lot about leadership and how to make a movement. So let's watch a movement happen, start to finish, in under three minutes and dissect some lessons from it. First, of course you know, a leader needs the guts to stand out and be ridiculed.
In the last video we talked a little bit about what inflation is in the Consumer Price Index and i thought i will actually show you data and maybe point out a few interesting things right over here so this right over here is the monthly press-release, there is a table from the monthly press-release issued by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and this is Table A which is really a summary of all the important things it's the changes in CPI for all urban consumers the CPl-U and they do it for non- or urban consumers and all the rest but the CPI that is quoted is the one for urban consumers the US city average I always find that the details are much more interesting than what you hear just on the news when people say "oh, the CPI changed by 0.5 per cent" and one thing I do wanna point out and this is true of the CPI this is true of all government statistics, and frankly this is true of any report that any company gives you, it's very important to keep in mind whether they're giving a sequential change or whether they're giving a year over year change so, for example, there might be a press release like this one and the text of it or maybe the headline number when you look at your local newspaper or your news report would say "look, in June 2011 inflation on all items, on the entire basket of goods went down by 0.2 per cent" and you might say "oh wow, look, there's no inflation, in fact the prices are going down,
 A couple of videos ago, we saw that in classic C-3 photosynthesis-- and once again it's called C-3 because the first time that carbon dioxide is fixed, it's fixed into a 3-carbon molecule. But we saw the problem with C-3 photosynthesis is that the enzyme that does the carbon fixation, it can also react with oxygen.
For those of you who are just starting to learn about the history of China in the first half of the 20th century, it can be a little bit confusing. So the goal of this video is really to give you an overview - to give you a scaffold - of the history of the first half of the 20th century in China. So as we go into the early 1900s, you have the end of imperial dynastic rule in China.
Now Sun Yat-sen was essentially in cahoots with
Yuan Shikai, who was a general in the old dynasty. And he has his own fascinating history. And Sun Yat-sen struck a deal with Yuan Shikai, who was very politically ambitious.
Yuan Shikai said, "Hey if I can get the Emperor Puyi," (who was the last emperor of China)
"if I can get him to officially abdicate, I want to become the president." So Sun Yat-sen agrees to this.
- each of these regions was controlled by different warlords who were in charge of a different military.
When this was going on during the Warlord era - especially as we go back into the early 1920s - in 1921 in particular - Sun Yat-sen hasn't given up. He goes to the south, in Guangzhou, and sets up, essentially, a revolutionary government out of a desire, from there, to consolidate power in China again, and to re-establish the Republic of China. So he goes there.
"Hey, we are the ones who really represent the spirit of what Sun Yat-sen represented - while the Kuomintang, under the leadership of Chang Kai-shek, said, "No no no! We represent what Sun Yat-sen represented when he first established the Republic of China."
- In 1934 - you have to remember - the Kuomintang - the Nationalist Party under Chiang Kai-shek - is going after the Communists.
And in 1934, he has them virtually surrounded, The Communists are nearly defeated. They're surrounded by the Nationalist Party.
Hiroshima and Nagasaki with atomic weapons - which essentially ends World War II in the Pacific Theater. It's a defeat for Japan. Japan lost World War Il.
But then, once there was a common enemy - Japan - that was very aggressively trying to take over more and more of China's, well, people and resources - trying to exert its imperial influence - then you had the two parties kind of [scale back their hostilities towards each other] and say, "Hey, we need to focus on fighting the Japanese!" But once World War II ended in 1945 - once the Japanese were defeated, then we saw a reigniting of full-scale civil war between the Chinese Communist Party and the Kuomintang. And this is probably one of the biggest comebacks in history.
John: Hi! I'm John Green.
We've tried to shy away from calling conflicts ideological or civilizational here on Crash Course, but in this case, the "clash of civilizations" model really does apply. Socialism, at least as Marx constructed it, wanted to take over the world, and many Soviets saw themselves in a conflict with bourgeois capitalism itself. And the Soviets saw American rebuilding efforts in Europe and Japan as the U.S. trying to expand its markets, which, by the way is exactly what we were doing.
Stalin's distrust of the U.S. and Britain kept growing as they refused to invade Europe and open up a second front against the Nazis. And some even say that the decision to drop the first Atomic Bombs on Japan was motivated in part by a desire to intimidate the Soviets. That sort of worked, but only insofar as it motivated the Soviets to develop atomic bombs of their own.
I want to do a quick video on something that you're likely to see in a statistics class, and that's the notion of a Type 1 Error. Type...type...type 1 error.
So for example, in a lot, in actually all of the hypothesis testing examples we've seen, we start assuming that the null hypothesis is true. We assume... We always assume that the null hypothesis is true.
And because it's so unlikely to get a statistic like that assuming that the null hypothesis is true, we decide to reject the null hypothesis. Or another way to view it is there's a 0.5% chance that we have made a Type 1 Error in rejecting the null hypothesis. Because if the null hypothesis is true there's a 0.5% chance that this could still happen.
We are asked which of these lines are perpendicular.
And it has to be perpendicular to one of the other lines, you can't be just perpendicular by yourself.
And perpendicular line, just so you have a visualization for what for perpendicular lines look like, two lines are perpendicular if they intersect at right angles.
So if this is one line right there, a perpendicular line will look like this.
A perpendicular line will intersect it, but it won't just be any intersection, it will intersect at right angles.
So these two lines are perpendicular.
Now, if two lines are perpendicular, if the slope of this orange line is m-- so let's say its equation is y is equal to mx plus, let's say it's b 1, so it's some y-intercept-- then the equation of this yellow line, its slope is going to be the negative inverse of this guy.
This guy right here is going to be y is equal to negative 1 over mx plus some other y-intercept.
Or another way to think about it is if two lines are perpendicular, the product of their slopes is going to be negative 1.
And so you could write that there. m times negative 1 over m, that's going to be-- these two guys are going to cancel out-- that's going to be equal to negative 1.
So let's figure out the slopes of each of these lines and figure out if any of them are the negative inverse of any of the other ones.
So line A, the slope is pretty easy to figure out, it's already in slope-intercept form, its slope is 3.
So line A has a slope of 3.
Line B, it's in standard form, not too hard to put it in slope-intercept form, so let's try to do it.
So let's do line B over here.
Line B, we have x plus 3y is equal to negative 21.
Let's subtract x from both sides so that it ends up on the right-hand side.
So we end up with 3y is equal to negative x minus 21.
And now let's divide both sides of this equation by 3 and we get y is equal to negative 1/3 x minus 7.
So this character's slope is negative 1/3.
So here m is equal to negative 1/3.
So we already see they are the negative inverse of each other.
You take the inverse of 3, it's 1/3, and then it's the negative of that.
Or you take the inverse of negative 1/3, it's negative 3, and then this is the negative of that.
So these two lines are definitely perpendicular.
Let's see the third line over here.
So line C is 3x plus y is equal to 10.
If we subtract 3x from both sides, we get y is equal to negative 3x plus 10.
So our slope in this case is negative 3.
Now this guy's the negative of that guy, this guy's slope is a negative, but not the negative inverse, so it's not perpendicular.
And this guy is the inverse of that guy but not the negative inverse, so this guy is not perpendicular to either of the other two, but line A and line B are perpendicular to each other.
Let's see if we can better understand what a cash flow statement for my simplified shipping truck example company would actually look like. Now I say it's simplified because this is a very simplified income statement for each of these periods. I'm not really showing all the expenses or all of the details that you would actually have for a shipping company but we really just care about the accounting.
"Wait! But we spent that $60,000, especially in year 1" And that goes here, under Capital Expenditures.
I want to make a quick correction to the last video. It doesn't really affect the learning of the last video, but I just want to make sure that you understand that I got the math a little bit wrong in the last video. I said that, you know, you had this state 300,000 years--so we talk about the Big Bang happening 13.7 billion years ago.
Solve p=2l+2w for l So this right here, this is just a formula for the perimeter of a rectangle. Perimeter is equal to 2 times the length plus 2 times the width.
They just want us to solve this equation right here, solve for I, so let's do that.
So we have p is equal to 2 times, 2 times I plus 2 times w so we can solve for l.
Let's isolate all of the I terms on one side, and the best way we can do that by leaving it here on the right and then getting rid of this 2w, and the best way to get rid of this 2w is to subtract is from the right and if you're gonna subtract it from the right you also have to subtract it from the left if you want this equality to hold so you have to also subtract if from the left and so the lefthand side becomes p-2w, p-2w and the right hand side you get, this 2w minus 2w, cancels out you just have a 2l. And then if you want to solve for l, you just have to divide both sides of the equation by 2! If you just divide both sides of this equation by 2 and we have isolated our l.
We get I is equal to p-2w over 2.
Or if we wanted to write it the other way we could write I is equal to p-2w over 2, and we are done.
And when everything is said and done, it's actually not going to end that well in terms of giving people Liberty.
Today I'm going to share my story of how I learned to live a more interesting, more fulfilling life. My story begins about three years ago, in the summer of 2008. I watched as my friends did an amazing thing.
One Laptop per Child, or OLPC, is a non-profit developed out of the MlT Media Lab. Their goal is to improve educational opportunities for the world's poorest children. To accomplish this goal, they developed an incredible green laptop.
Nicholas is the founder of OLPC. As I was watching this video, as I heard about what my friends were doing, I was hooked.
"How can I help?" Of course, my friends responded wonderfully. They didn't point out my inexperience.
Me and my friends at Indiana University have been doing this project and OLPC is interested.
So as a group, we started to ask: "How can we help?" We got a pretty amazing answer.
OLPC asked me and my friend Paul to run a new program for them called OLPC Corps. The idea was this: We'd recruit 150 university students from all over the world.
I had doubted myself before, when it was just me and my friends at Indiana. Now I was supposed to run a program for OLPC? I was a full-time student at Indiana.
It turns out I believed in what I was doing. I believed then, and I still do, that education and technology can help address some of the most pressing problems in our world. I believe that every child, no matter where he or she is born, should be able to explore and create and find a love for learning.
OLPC believes these things, too. Once I figured out why I was doing it, everything else fell into place. For a few months, I was a volunteer.
"How can I help?" Let's step back and think about that question. When I first got involved, it was a small step.
What are you passionate about?
How many times have you seen a project, an idea, maybe a TED talk, and been inspired? And what have you done to follow your passions? Sharing ideas is wonderful and incredibly important.
I have these 3 star patches - I guess you could call them - right over here. And so I could say,
"If I had 1 group of 3 star patches, how many star patches do I have?" So I literally have 1 group of 3 star patches. Well that means that I have 3 star patches.
I'm standing in front of you today in all humility, wanting to share with you my journey of the last six years in the field of service and education. And I'm not a trained academic. Neither am I a veteran social worker.
"When will you start? How many schools will you start? How many children will you get?
SB: We have 80 percent attendance for all our parents-teachers meeting. Sometimes it's even 100 percent, much more than many privileged schools.
"You know, we want to learn how to read and write. Can you teach us?" So, we started an afterschool for our parents, for our mothers. We had 25 mothers who came regularly after school to study.
Take a look at this little girl who was one of the 28 children from all privileged schools, best schools in the country that was selected for the Duke University talent identification program and was sent to IlM Ahmedabad.
Video: Girl: Duke IlMA Camp.
"Yes ma'am, what you want?" It was so good to hear! (Laughter) (Applause) This girl was working as a maid before she came to school.
We have professors from MlT, Berkeley, Stanford, Indian Institute of Science who come and teach our children lots of scientific formulas, experiments, much beyond the classroom. Art, music are considered therapy and mediums of expression.
Find the probability of getting exactly two heads when flipping three coins. So let's think about the sample space, here. Let's think about all of the possible outcomes.
The function f(x) is defined as f(x) = 49 - (x ^2). Find the value of f(5). So whenever you're dealing with a function, you take your input -- in this case, our input is going to be our 5.
 We're told that the total cost of filling up your car with gas varies directly with the number of gallons of gasoline you are purchasing. So this first statement tells us that if x is equal to the number of gallons purchased, and y is equal to the cost of filling up the car, this first statement tells us that y varies directly with the number of gallons, with x.
So what do we have here We have a triangle, and we know that the length of AC is equal to the length of CB, so this is an isosceles triangle we have Two of its legs are equal to each other
We figured out what x is And we can actually figure out what these angles are This is x+10, then you have 40 + 10
A carpet measures 7 feet long and has a diagonal measurement of square root of 74 feet. Find the width of the carpet. So let's draw ourselves a carpet here.
So that means that this distance, right here-- draw it a little bit neater than that --this distance right here, the diagonal of the carpet, is the square root of 74 feet. And what they want to know is the width of the carpet. Find the width of the carpet.
74 minus 49, well, we can do a little bit of regrouping or borrowing here, if we don't want to do it in our head. We can make this a 14. This becomes a 6.
 We need to factor 49x squared minus 49y squared. Now here there's a pattern that you might already be familiar with.
If you multiply this out, you have a times a, which is a squared, plus a times negative b, which is negative ab-- that's a times negative b-- plus b times a, which is the same thing as ab. And then you have b times negative b, which is negative b squared. So when you do that, you have a negative ab and a positive ab, they cancel out.
And you're just going to be left with an a squared minus a b squared. Now, this thing that we have here is exactly that pattern.
49x squared is a perfect square.
49y squared is a perfect square. We can rewrite it like that. We could rewrite this over here as 7x squared minus-- and
Evaluate the expression 5y to the 4th minus y squared when y is equal to 3 so every place you see a y here we can just replace it with a three to evaluate it so it becomes 5 times three to the fourth power minus three squared, all I did is every time we saw a y here, I put a three there so what does this evaluate to, we have to remember our order of operations remember parenthesis comes first, sometimes it's referred to as PEMDAS
P is for Parenthesis, E is for Exponents, M and D are for multiplication and division and they are really at the same level of priority and then addition and subtraction are at the same level.
If you really want to do it properly should be P-E and then multiplication and division are at the same level and addition and subtraction are at the same level What this tells us is that we do parenthesis first and expeonentiation takes priority over everything else here, so we have to evaluate these exponents before we multiply anything or before we subtract anything. So the one exponent we have to evaluate is three squared so just remember three to the first is three, it's just three times itself once so it's just 3.

Fractional exponents can be a little daunting at first, so it never hurts to do as many examples as possible. So let's do a few. What if we had 25/9, and we wanted to raise it to the 1/2 power?
Everyone is both a learner and a teacher. This is me being inspired by my first tutor, my mom, and this is me teaching
Introduction to Artificial Intelligence to 200 students at Stanford University. Now the students and I enjoyed the class, but it occurred to me that while the subject matter of the class is advanced and modern, the teaching technology isn't. In fact, I use basically the same technology as this 14th-century classroom.
Sebastian Thrun, and I thought, there must be a better way. We challenged ourselves to create an online class that would be equal or better in quality to our Stanford class, but to bring it to anyone in the world for free. We announced the class on July 29th, and within two weeks, 50,000 people had signed up for it.
Benjamin Bloom had showed that one-on-one tutoring works best, so that's what we tried to emulate, like with me and my mom, even though we knew it would be one-on-thousands. Here, an overhead video camera is recording me as I'm talking and drawing on a piece of paper.
like, "Here's a formula, now tell me the value of Y when X is equal to two." We preferred open-ended questions. One student wrote, "Now I'm seeing
Bayes networks and examples of game theory everywhere I look." And I like that kind of response. That's just what we were going for.
From Daphne Koller and Andrew Ng, we learned the concept of "flipping" the classroom. Students watched the videos on their own, and then they come together to discuss them.
From Eric Mazur, I learned about peer instruction, that peers can be the best teachers, because they're the ones that remember what it's like to not understand.
Sebastian and I have forgotten some of that. Of course, we couldn't have a classroom discussion with tens of thousands of students, so we encouraged and nurtured these online forums. And finally, from Teach For America,
Sebastian's teaching another class now. I'll do one in the fall.
Stanford Coursera, Udacity, MlTx and others have more classes coming. It's a really exciting time. But to me, the most exciting part of it is the data that we're gathering.
(Music)
What you just heard are the interactions of barometric pressure, wind and temperature readings that were recorded of Hurricane Noel in 2007. The musicians played off a three-dimensional graph of weather data like this. Every single bead, every single colored band, represents a weather element that can also be read as a musical note.
This is the 1913 Trio performing one of my pieces at the Milwaukee Art Museum. Meanwhile, I use these scores as blueprints to translate into sculptural forms like this, that function still in the sense of being a three-dimensional weather visualization, but now they're embedding the visual matrix of the musical score, so it can actually be read as a musical score. What I love about this work is that it challenges our assumptions of what kind of visual vocabulary belongs in the world of art, versus science.
We're asked to round 152, 137, 245, and 354 to the nearest 100, which is another way of saying round each of these numbers to the nearest multiple of 100. So let's think about them one by one. So let's draw a number line here.
[MUSlC PLAYlNG] What I want to do in this video is talk a little bit about compounding interest. And then, have a little bit of a discussion of a way to quickly, kind of an approximate way to figure out how quickly something compounds.
And now I'm going to have to solve for x and I'm going to have to do some logarithms here. You can divide both sides by 100. You get 1.1 to the x is equal to 2.
Let's multiply 7 times 253 and see what we get. So just like in the last example what I'd like to do is I'd like to rewrite the largest number first (so that's 253) and then write the smaller number below it and align the place value, the 7, it only has an ones place.
 Let's do some word problems that are essentially dealing with slope of a line. You might see these being referred to as direct variation models, because we're going to model what's being described in this problem.
Is equal to 12. So it'll take us 12 minutes to fill up a 30 gallon bathtub. We have our minutes right there.
Amen is-- or maybe A-man, I don't know the best way to pronounce that name-- is using a hose-- let me scroll over a little bit-- is using a hose to fill his new swimming pool for the first time. He starts the hose at 10 PM-- let me write this down.
This is 8 hours later, right? This is time 8. We don't know what this is.
Let's assume that each of these notches is two. That is two, four, six, eight, ten, twelve, fourteen. So this tells us that as we run 14, we rise 1.
I've gotten feedback that all the Chuck Noris imagery in the last video might have been a little bit too overwhelming. So, for this video, I've included something a little bit more soothing. So let's try to simplify some more expressions. and we'll see we're just applying ideas that we already knew about.
So this is one "3x + 5", and then to that, I'm going to add another "3x + 5". This is literally what 2(3x + 5) means. Well this, is the same thing as... if we're gonna just have a look right over here, we have now two "3x".
"7" times "-5" is "-35". So, we simplified this part of it. Let's simplify the right hand side.
And then "-2" times "4y"...
"-2" times "4" is "-8", so it's going to be "-8y". So, let's write a "-8y" right over here. And now we're done simplifying.
So, this whole thing simplified, using a little bit of distributive property and combining similar or like terms, we got to "13y - 55".
Hi. I'm here to talk to you about the importance of praise, admiration and thank you, and having it be specific and genuine. And the way I got interested in this was,
I know a gentleman, married for 25 years, who's longing to hear his wife say, "Thank you for being the breadwinner, so I can stay home with the kids," but won't ask. I know a woman who's good at this.
"I'd really like you to thank me for all these things I did in the house and with the kids." And he goes, "Oh, this is great, this is great." And praise really does have to be genuine, but she takes responsibility for that.
In a language class, the girl to boy ratio is 5 to 8. So for every 5 girls, we have 8 boys. If there are a total of 65 students, how many girls are there?
If you were to borrow money for different amounts of time, you could imagine the person lending you the money might charge you a different annual interest rate depending on the perceived risk of having the money out there for that amount of time. And the same thing is true when people lend money to the federal government. So when you think about U.S. Treasuries and U.S. Treasuries that have different maturity
- and maturity just means: When is the government going to pay you back - You could imagine that there are different interest rates or there are different yields to maturity on that debt.
What I want to do in this video is how supply and / or demand might change based on changes on some factors of the market and then think about what that might do to the equilibrium price and equilibrium quantity.
So let's say at some period, this is what the supply curve looks like, and this is what the demand looks like and then all of a sudden this thing happens. A new disease resistant apple is invented what's likely to happen for the next period? Well a new disease resistant apple being invented, this is something that clearly impacts the growers and clearly impacts the suppliers.
Hank: Behavior is action in response to a stimulus. My cat Cameo is now responding to both an external stimulus, the sound of a bag of treats, and an internal stimulus, her hunger, or at least her insatiable desire for treats.
Given that the Chinese Central Bank is printing yuan in order to keep it devalued to other foreign currencies --especially relative to the dollar-- a question that may have jumped into your brain is:
"Is this causing inflation?" And when I'm talking about inflation, I'm talking about price inflation: Is it making a basket of goods in China more expensive?
'monetary inflation,' that by definition is increasing. They are definitely increasing the money supply, but is it making the price of goods and services in China more expensive? And to answer that question I have this article here from the NYTimes, by Keith Bradsher, and he writes,
"In China, consumer prices were 5.1% higher in November than a year earlier." Remember, in the US we try to target inflation to be between 1 and 3%. So, the official government data--this is according to official government data-- they admit that their inflation is at 5.1%.
"And many economists say the official figures actually understate the rate of inflation, which might in reality be twice as high." And there are tons of ways to engineer the actual inflation depending on what the basket of goods is and how you adjust for things
"Now, though, that cheap currency policy seems to be reaching its limits. The extra renminbi [and this is a point of confusion when talking about the currency of China... The renminbi is the name of the currency, while the Yuan is the name people use when they say,
"Hey, I gave you five yuan." Or, "You owe me five yuan." They wouldn't say, "You owe me five renminbi." And a good analogy is: if you go to Great Britain and buy something, they'll say,
"You owe five pounds." So, in Great Britain, five pounds is what they say, when you're actually buying something, but the name of the currency is called the 'sterling.' It's kind of like, people the 'dollar' 'US Legal Tender.' That's the equivalent of 'renminbi,' whereas the yuan might be like the dollar.
"Money supply figures for December, which the central bank released on Tuesday, showed that cash and bank deposits were increasing at a rate twice as fast as even China's soaring economy. So, if you increase the money supply roughly in line with the growth in the economy then you wouldn't experience too much inflation, but they're experiencing it twice as fast. " Ever more renminbi are available to buy goods and services."
So you see, they deliberately trying to keep their currency devalued, but they're reaching kinda a breaking-point where they won't be able to do it as aggressively going forward.

In the last video, we made a visual argument as to why this expression has to be less than 1/3, and this expression we already figured out is the fraction that are bears. Now we will make an algebraic argument, or I could call it an analytic argument. And to make this argument, I'm going to leave this expression-- we know this is the fraction that are bears-- and I'm going to write this 1/3 in a form that

Why have I named it Argora? When I take away the second 'r' in its name, actually means 'a place of congregation' according to the English Dictionary.
Similarly, my goal for Argora is to help bring people of different language backgrounds together by lowering the language barrier on the web. So how did I come up with this idea? Last year, I was visiting Japan, and once I stepped out of the airport,
is to promote global collaborations for development, so many businesses are interested in investing in developing countries like China, India, and so on. But some are deterred because of the language barrier.
The translation on Argora's cross-language web search is powered by Google Translate. When you first visit www.argora.net, the page language will actually be set to your browser's default language. Let's give it a while to load the page first.
- thank you, you can hold the applause for afterwards - (Applause) So, if you hover over any of the results, the original content will pop up the site If you click on the link in the pop-up, you will open the page and translation, but if you click on a link on the main page, you will actually open up the page using Google Translate, and have each piece of content translated into your page language.
On the screen, left, you can see you actually translate the whole page on the fly. Isn't that cool? (Applause)
Creating Argora is my first step to realize the change I want to see in the world. Let us build a better tomorrow by being the change we want to see in this world. Thank you.

Swirling spiral arms of galaxy M33 can be seen in visible light, but the true extent of these spiral arms are revealed in ultraviolet light. Just as a dog can hear a whistle just outside the range of human hearing, bugs can see light just outside the range our eyes can see. A bug zapper emits this ultraviolet light to attract insects.
Johann Ritter conducted an experiment in 1801 to find out what, if any, electromagnetic waves are beyond violet. Ritter knew that photographic paper would turn black more rapidly in blue light than in red light. So he tried exposing the paper beyond the violet end of the visible spectrum.
These ultraviolet rays, or UV radiation, vary in wavelength from 400 nanometers to 10 nanometers and can be subdivided into 3 regions: UV-A, UV-B and UV-C.
Visible light from the Sun passes through the atmosphere and reaches the Earth's surface. UV-A, long wave ultraviolet, is the closest to visible light.
Most UV-A also reaches the surface. But shorter wavelengths, called UV-B, are the harmful rays that cause sunburn. Fortunately, about 95% of these harmful UV-B rays are absorbed by ozone in the Earth's atmosphere.
UV-C rays are the shortest and most harmful and are almost completely absorbed by our atmosphere.
The Ozone Monitoring Instrument aboard NASA's Aura satellite detects ultraviolet radiation to help scientists study and monitor the chemistry of our atmosphere, including UV absorbing ozone. While atmospheric protection from harmful UV radiation is good for humans... it complicates the study of naturally produced UV rays in the Universe, by scientists here on the Earth's surface. Young hot stars shine most of their light beyond the visible light spectrum at ultraviolet wavelengths.
Galaxy Evolution Explorer, GALEX, image from NASA. Chemical substances, both atoms and molecules, interact with UV light making this region particularly interesting to scientists. An ultraviolet instrument aboard Cassini has detected hydrogen, oxygen, water ice, and methane in the Saturn system.
UV data have also revealed details of Saturn's aurorae. Scientists also use UV waves shining from distant stars to view permanently shadowed regions of lunar craters.
The Lyman-Alpha Mapping Project, or LAMP, instrument aboard NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter can use this faint star-shine to look for possible water ice on the moon.
Ultraviolet rays may be harmful to humans, but they are essential to studying the health of our planet's protective atmosphere and give us valuable clues to the formation and composition of distant celestial objects.
I got up this morning at 6:10 a.m. after going to sleep at 12:45 a.m. I was awakened once during the night. My heart rate was 61 beats per minute -- my blood pressure, 127 over 74.
And my score on the Narcissism Personality Index, or the NPl-16, is a reassuring 0.31. We know that numbers are useful for us when we advertise, manage, govern, search. I'm going to talk about how they're useful when we reflect,
People were tracking their food via Twitter, their kids' diapers on their iPhone. They were making detailed journals of their spending, their mood, their symptoms, their treatments. Now, we know some of the technological facts that are driving this change in our lifestyle -- the uptake and diffusion of mobile devices, the exponential improvement in data storage and data processing, and the remarkable improvement in human biometric sensors.
You're probably familiar with the Nike+ system. I just put it up because that little blue dot is the sensor. It's really just a pressure sensor
And Nike knows how to get your pace and distance from just that sensor.
This is the strap that people use to transmit heart-rate data to their Nike+ system. This is a beautiful, new device that gives you detailed sleep tracking data, not just whether you're asleep or awake, but also your phase of sleep -- deep sleep, light sleep, REM sleep. The sensor is just a little strip of metal in that headband there.
Here's a biometric device: a pair of Apple Earbuds. Last year, Apple filed some patents to get blood oxygenation, heart rate and body temperature via the Earbuds. What is this for?
Welcome to the presentation on functions. Functions are something that when I first learned it, it was kind of like I had a combination of I was, one, confused, and at the same time I was like, well what's even the point of, of learning this.
I'm Jessi, and this is my suitcase. But before I show you what I've got inside, I'm going to make a very public confession, and that is,
We have the proportion x minus 9 over 12 is equal to 2/3. And we want to solve for the x that satisfies this proportion. Now, there's a bunch of ways that you could do it.
Basically, there's a major demographic event going on. And it may be that passing the 50 percent urban point is an economic tipping point. So the world now is a map of connectivity.
It used to be that Paris and London and New York were the largest cities. What we have now is the end of the rise of the West. That's over.
The question is, why? And here's the unromantic truth -- and the city air makes you free, they said in Renaissance Germany.
So some people go to places like Shanghai but most go to the squatter cities where aesthetics rule. And these are not really a people oppressed by poverty.
One-sixth of the GDP in India is coming out of Mumbai. They are constantly upgrading, and in a few cases, the government helps. Education is the main event that can happen in cities.
Al Gore knows. It's basically everything. There's no unemployment in squatter cities.
One-sixth of humanity is there. It's soon going to be more than that. So here's the first punch line: cities have defused the population bomb.
Stars have shined down on earth's life for billions of years. Now we're shining right back up.
Thank you.
A club of nine people wants to choose a board of three officers, President, Vice President, and Secretary. Assuming the officers are chosen at random, what is the probability that the officers are Marcia for president,
Sabita for Vice President, and Robert for Secretary? So to think about the probability of Marcia-- so let me write this-- President is equal to Marcia, or Vice
President is equal to Sabita, and
Secretary is equal to Robert. This, right here, is one possible outcome, one specific outcome. So it's one outcome out of the total number of outcomes, over the total number of possibilities.
You have President, you have Vice President, and you have Secretary.
Now let's just assume that we're going to fill the slot of President first.
We don't have to do President first, but we're just going to pick here.
So if we're just picking President first, we haven't assigned anyone to any officers just yet, so we have nine people to choose from. So there are nine possibilities here.
Now, when we go to selecting our Vice President, we would have already assigned one person to the President.
And when we assign our Secretary, we would've already assigned our President and Vice President, so we're only going to have seven people to pick from.
So the total permutations here or the total number of possibilities, or the total number of ways, to pick
President, Vice President, and Secretary from nine people, is going to be 9 times 8 times 7. Which is, let's see, 9 times 8 is 72. 72 times 7, 2 times 7 is 14, 7 times 7 is 49 plus 1 is 50.
So to answer the question, the probability of Marcia being President, Sabita being Vice President, and Robert being
Secretary is 1 over the total number of possibilities, which is 1 over 504. That's the probability.
We're asked to solve the quadratic equation, negative 3x squared, plus 10x, minus 3 is equal to 0. And it's already written in standard form. And there's many ways to solve this, but in particular I'll solve it using the quadratic formula.
We have negative 3x squared Plus 10x, minus 3 is equal to 0, and actually solved it twice using the quadratic formula, to show you that, as long as we manipulated this, in the valid way, the quadratic formula will give us the exact same roots, or the exact same solution to this equation. So, in this form right over here, what are a, b, c?
Negative 10.
Plus or minus the square root of b squared. b is 10 so b squared is 100 minus 4 times a times c.
So minus 4 times negative 3 times negative 3. Let me just write it down.
Minus 4 times negative 3 times negative 3. All of that's under the radical sign. And then all of that is over 2a.
So if we take the positive version, we say x could be equal to negative 10 plus 8, is negative 2 over negative 6. So that was taking the plus version. That's this right over here.
If we take the negative square root, negative 10 minus 8, so let's take negative 10 minus 8, that would be x is equal to negative 10 minus 8 is negative 18, and that's going to be over negative 6.
Over negative 6. Negative 18 divided by negative 6 is positive 3. So the two roots for this quadratic equation are positive.
Minus 4 times a times c. A times c is 9, times 4 is 36. So minus 36 all of that over 2 times a, all of that over 6.
It will be good to introduce some basic terminology that is commonly used in artificial intelligence to distinguish different types of problems. The very first word I will teach you is fully versus partially observable. An environment is called fully observable if what your agent can sense at any point in time is completely sufficient to make the optimal decision.
What is the cost of 14.6 gallons of gasoline at $2.70 per gallon? So we have 14.6 gallons, and each gallon's going to cost $2.70. Or we can even view $2.70 as 2.7 dollars.
There are billions of galaxies in the observable universe. And each of them contains hundreds billions of stars. In one of these gallasies, orbiting one of these stars,
You say 'to-mae-to' I say 'to-mah-to', they are animals alright. They are monkeys. Monkeys with high speed digital fiber optics technology.
We've talked a good bit about how the Chinese government is printing yuan to buy foreign exchange to keep the yuan devalued. What I want to do in this video is actually to look at the data to show I wasn't making all that stuff up. This is actually data from the People's Bank of China.

We have now seen the Nazis come to power in 1933 - and by mid 1933 they are the only allowed party in Germany. And Hitler is fundamentally the dictator of Germany. But they aren't happy with just that consolidated power, they want to ensure that they stay in power.
He was head of the Storm Battalion or the SA, which was the paramilitary group that the SS splintered out of and it was far more independent than Hitler would have liked and it was not popular amongst the German people because of its violence - and Hitler and his lieutenants viewed Röhm as a potential rival to Hitler's authority within the Nazi party. And so in 1934, June 30th in particular - or we could say June 30th to July 2nd - you have what's called the Night of the Long Knives and it really should be called the Nights of the Long Knives but the Night of the Long Knives, where under the pretext of a supposed a coup d'état or a putsch on the part of Ernst Röhm
The SS and the Gestapo start rounding up Röhm, his allies and any perceived enimies of Hitler. Start rounding them up and eliminating them and shooting them... And Ernst Röhm is arrested and when he refuses to kill himself in his jail cell he is shot at point-blank range.
A club of nine people wants to choose a board of three officers: a President, a Vice President, and a Secretary. How many ways are there to choose the board from the nine people? Now, we're going to assume that one person can't hold more than one office.
Let's say we were picking the President slot first and we haven't appointed any other slots yet.
How many possibilities are there for President? Well, the club has nine people, so there's nine possibilities for President.
There's going to be nine possibilities for President. Now, we're going to pick one of those nine. We're going to kind of take them out of the running for the other two offices.
Because someone's going to be President, so one of the nine is going to be President. There's nine possibilities, but one of the nine is going to be President. So you take that person aside.
Well, now there's only seven possibilities for Secretary. So if you want to think about all of the different ways there are to choose a board from the nine people, there's the 9 for President times the 8 for Vice President times the 7 for Secretary. You didn't have to do it this way.
Let's see if we can use our example to understand the 3 types of income statements and hopefully understanding those income statements will also help us understand this example. So I'm gonna start of, we're gonna focus on month 2 and what I've done is I've rewritten some of this accrual income statement down here so it really looks like a statement so this right here is the income statement for month 2 on an accrual basis. And that month, we said we had $400 of revenue, $200 of expense, $400 minus $200 gives us $200 of income.
It describes it right over here the change in equity, sometime the change in retained earnings, or just change in equity, that is going to be the $200 in net income that the company got over that time period. Now there's one thing that you're probably confused by right now well you know, how do we reconcile everything with the cash we know that over this period we got $200 in income on an accrual basis. But when you look at the cash, we went from $100 positive cash, to negative $100 in cash.
What I wanted to talk to you about today is two things: one, the rise of a culture of availability; and two, a request. So we're seeing a rise of this availability being driven by mobile device proliferation, globally, across all social strata. We're seeing, along with that proliferation of mobile devices, an expectation of availability.
Apologies to Hans Rosling -- he said anything that's not using real stats is a lie -- but the big delta there is how we deal with this from a public standpoint. So we've developed certain tactics and strategies to cover up. This first one's called "the lean."
"The stretch." OK, the gentleman on the left is saying, "Screw you, I'm going to check my device."
Nothing says "I love you" like "Let me find somebody else I give a damn about." Or, this one, coming to us from India.
"You are not as important as, literally, almost anything that could come to me through this device." Look around you. There might be somebody on one right now, participating in multi-dimensional engagement.
What I want to do in this video is to explore the notion of a matrix outside the context of a surprisingly good movie that involves Keanu Reeves. And it is actually the first of three. I guess we could call the three movies combined 'The Matrices.'
Consider the numbers 1/3 , 7 , -15 To which of these sets of numbers these numbers belong to. Lets review each of these
like -4,-3,-2,-1 0, 1, 2, 3,4, ... so on and so forth rational numbers are numbers that can be expressed as a ratio of two integers.Rational number can be expressed as m/n where m and n are integers and n cannot be 0 as anything divided by 0 is not defined. But m could be 0 as 0 can be expressed as 0/1 or 0/2 or 0/3 or 0/-537 these are all representations of 0 Irrational numbers are numbers that cannot be expressed as ratios of integers examples of irrational numbers are numbers that keeps repeating on and on and on π, √2 are examples of irrational numbers and then real numbers are really all of these combined if you are combining the rational numbers and irrational numbers you are talking about real numbers.every real number is either rational or irrational.
lets try 7 number 7 is a natural number, whole number any natural is a whole number any natural and whole number si an integer so 7 is also a integer. any number that is natural, whole and integer is a rational number. we can write 7 as 7/1 we can write any integer as that number / 1 if it is rational it cannot be irrational. it is also going to be real we have -15. it is not a natural number natural number are positive integers only it is not a whole number it is an integer, it is the opposite of +15 it is rational as it can be written as -15/1 and because it is rational it cannot be irrational it is also real.

This film is dedicated to friends and family who died while it was in the making.
Heard about the guy who fell off a skyscraper?
On his way down past each floor, he kept saying to reassure himself:
"So far so good..." "so far so good..."
How you fall doesn't matter.
It's how you land!
More rioting in the projects outside the city.
Last night a mob of youths attacked a police station in the Muguet projects.
Pitched battles left 14 officers injured.
33 arrests were made.
A mall and nearby buildings were damaged by looters who dispersed around 4 a.m.
Alleged police brutality sparked the riots 2 days ago. A local teen was severely beaten under questioning. The officer was suspended.
The victim, Abdel Ichaha, is in hospital in critical condition.
Got a looter under arrest, a minor.
SAYlD:
FUCK THE POLlCE
Vinz!
Where the fuck is he? What?
- Whadda ya mean "what"?
Can't fuckin' say hello? Chill, Sayid. What's up?
Tell your bro to come out.
What for?
- Tell him!
What for?
- Just tell him! What for?
Is this a TV game show?
Quit hollering!
You guys made enough noise last night!
You see me last night?
I wasn't here. Shut up! Don't play dumb!
If I wake him, he'll get mad. You try!
I hope the cops tan your hide!
Vinz...
Shut up, Sayid.
Shut up?
Be nice or you're history, fuckface!
You stink!
You want to play this early?
One...
Two... Three. You lose.
Fuck your sister. I told you not to talk about her!
She sucks Donald Duck.
Get lost! Jew boy!
You bogus kike, you're nowhere!
I saw a cow. - What?
A cow. Got some smoke? In the box.
Last night, during the riot, I dashed behind a building:
Wham! I ran right into a cow.
Really?
Stop smoking, your brain's fried!
Off my bed! I'll say you're taking drugs!
I'll cut your throat, hang you up, you'll drown in your blood!
Granma!
Get off the bed.
You get out.
Stay off my bed!
Get lost, you snitch!
Move it.
Watch your mouth with my sister!
You'll skip temple! Got any salt? - Respect your granma!
You my father?
What about Dad? You my mother now?
Go to school!
It burned down.
Burned down! Savages! Start that way and soon you'll skip temple!
But we'd all be going the same way! Mazeltov! You talkin' to me?
You talkin' to me, mothafucka! ...the guy says:
"For cash, I'd even murder!"
He tells his friend: "I'd even waste you." The friend freaks, so the guy says:
"Don't worry, you're a buddy.
"I won't waste you for cash, I'll do it for free!"
What a killer line! "For free!"
"I'll waste you for free!" What a line, Vinz! I got it the first time. Tell your brother to come see me!
What a killer put-down! "I'll waste you for free!"
Shut up and gimme the joint.
A killer line! - Killer. "I'd waste you for free."
Can't do better than that!
Why you so uptight?
Mothafucka!
Bastards wrecked everything! Check that! I don't believe it!
The doorway's too narrow.
Chill, Sayid! There he is.
He must be pissed off.
Took him two years to get this gym!
Your dope's good, Vinz.
Not mine.
It's Hubert's.
Don't bogart, Sayid. Thought you quit smoking?
Me too. What happened here? Guess.
A fire? You win the prize, Einstein!
Kiss mine, cousin!
I knew it'd go up in smoke one day. So why'd you bust ass to get it? 'Cause he wanted to, dickface!
I don't want to know. How'd the car get in here?
The doorway's not big enough.
We dissed them, spit on them! But the cops didn't move an inch.
Then the mothers stepped aside to make a path...
Then these plainclothes pigs came out with wooden clubs.
They hit a homeboy, like real bad!
Kept clubbing him till we tore into 'em.
I kicked a pig right in the head!
That's a Yamaha. More like your Mom on a Harley! It's Mohammed's bike.
He fixed the exhaust.
No, it's Vinz's Mom on a Yamaha!
Which Mohammed?
Farida's brother? Farida with the driver's licence?
No, Farida from the supermarket.
Anyway, it was a scene.
You should've been there Hubert. It was intense.
Tear gas, 2 nights in a cop shop, all the fists you can eat, getting hell at home:
"Sorry cousin, but I ain't buyin'!" Gimme a break! It was war against the pigs, in living color!
I was trying to make some cash.
Your bogus riot fucked it up!
When a brother goes down, I stand up!
What brother?
Do I know the guy?
I won't take hits for a homeboy gangsta I don't know.
Let's go.
I mean it!
Abdel's no gangsta.
OK, but I'm not faster than a speeding bullet!
Hey, hands off the hot dogs!
Gimme one.
And go broke?
Don't make us cry!
I'll make you cry, Sayid! Everyone pays the same! Except Hubert, it's his building.
A buck for one, OK two!
You're a drag!
You should try one.
Got a buck? - Yeah, for me! Here.
No way, I'll remember this!
So remember.
- Never forget.
Don't be a jerk.
I'll pay later.
How? With your sister?
Don't talk that way about her!
Chill out, you bogus Arab! Sayid!
Come back with that! Got any change? We're broke!
2 bits.
- We're broke. ...The judge says I go to jail, or do jobs for the City.
Community service?
The pits! Ever do it?
Jail's bad enough! You'd rather do time?
Your bro stole a dog!
Liar! - His mouth is full!
Put it on my tab. Liar! Your nose is growing!
I'll bust your nose, Sayid!
Beat it!
A.45! Like the gun in "Lethal Weapon."
We saw that movie together! It was a 9mm.
Glock! What? - No, it wasn't!
That was a Desert Eagle.
He shot at the truck!
That wasn't "Lethal Weapon"!
What are you talking about?
A cop lost his handgun during the riot.
That's a good one!
I don't know the pig who lost his piece.
But I'd like to know who found it!
No joke! ...I'll sleep, eat, lift weights.
Everyone's been inside, except me.
A month for theft is pathetic!
Not in your league!
What league?
I was never inside! - You got nabbed. I quit in time!
Come look! We got visitors.
Over here!
It's the mayor!
Up Your Honor, Mr. Mayor!
Mothafucka! Cut the stereo!
Who's in charge here?
You, Nordeen?
What's going on here?
Think you're in Disneyland? You're not allowed up here. You gotta go down.
We're causing no trouble. Still, you've got to get off the roof.
We like it up here.
Off the roof.
You learn that shit at Notre Dame? Cut it out!
Quiet everyone!
I'll handle this!
- Forget it!
You can't stay here!
So fold your little tents, grab your chairs... and let's all go downstairs nice and easy.
OK! Who's gonna make us leave?
Your goons or you, in your little uniform?
Nordeen, we're doing our job. Leave us alone! Don't talk to me like that, I don't know you.
Your mother drinks Bud!
Anyone who wants to stay, stay!
Heat's off. I'm staying.
- You're going. Let me stay, Nordeen. What did I say?
So what do you do? - I go! OK, I'm going!
Vinz, c'mon!
Don't play tough guy!
You always wimp out! ...You see 'em in porn stores.
What are they called?
G-strings.
What? - G-strings, moron.
She had one on, I swear it.
I fucked her like an animal.
We were in the room... she kept screaming for more.
Guy next door pounded the wall we were so noisy.
You dreamt you fucked her!
What? You know the bitch? - I know her, she has AlDS.
Get outta here!
Hi, we're from TV. - What's this? Were you in the riot last night?
Did you break things, burn cars? We look like looters, lady?
- I didn't say that. So what do we look like? - Nothing special.
Get out the car! This ain't Thoiry. We got work to do.
What kind of work?
Stirring up shit?
For a juicy scoop!
- No camera!
Quit snooping in the 'hood, fuckface!
Stop taping!
Quit taping, dickhead!
This ain't Thoiry!
What's with all the assholes today?
That fuckin' broad...
What's Thoiry? A drive-in safari park.
This ain't no zoo!
Open up, WalMart!
You fuckin' jerks. Talk nice, we're in France.
It's 1 p.m.
And you're in bed?
What's with the hair net?
Lay off! You a movie star, WalMart?
What's this shitty TV?
Watch where you sit!
Just sweat pants!
Where's the new TV?
It's too big to move.
I came by for my cash.
Where were you?
I don't have it.
Don't you know what happened?
Go see what your pals did.
Foued's brother did that.
So what? Give me his address.
Look what he did to my car!
Look what he did! Just look!
Leave that alone.
I lost ten grand!
I can't work now.
WalMart, it's just a car!
That's what you say!
You don't realize. It's all I got. Cut it out!
Leave that alone! A homeboy's dying, fuck your car! "A homeboy!" Big deal!
You disgust me!
That car's all I have. It's my life!
They're showing the riot! - My car's more important! Look, the riot.
Some TV! - Sure, bust it!
Fix the antenna!
- I'm trying! It's David!
How'd he get on TV? I was over there, they missed me!
Fix it! I can't see a thing! - This TV sucks!
How'd that fucker get on TV?
Hey, gimme my money! I don't have it. Snoopy has it.
Gimme my coat and get outta my face! You guys must be happy.
A cop lost his gun in the riot.
I hope the guy who finds it uses it uptown, not here for once!
Forget it, we'll get even!
You know that show, "Candid Camera"? So this celebrity's sure he's been set up.
His buddy's fixed it with the camera guys. The celebrity thinks they're out to get him.
He always eats in the same joint. He's sure they'll film him there.
The others convince him there's a hidden camera.
He sees the TV truck, a camera behind the mirror and the guy with him pretends to act weird.
The celebrity thinks he'll fool 'em, pretending he hasn't noticed. He thinks all hell will break loose.
But they just film him, jumpy, waiting for shit to happen.
So you see this guy... Cut it out, Sayid! Wasn't me!
Each time the waiter passes he thinks it'll happen. Then a guy asks him for his autograph.
The celeb thinks it's a trick and Starts ranting at the guy, who doesn't know what's up, so he gets mad. They Start fighting, and the Candid Camera guys have to break it up.
It was a killer punch out. Then what?
That's all.
Who was the celebrity? Dunno, but he was real famous.
I don't remember.
This looks like trouble.
See ya.
WE'RE THE FUTURE
What did they want?
"Don't get mad, get even."
It's Abdel's brother. He's got a pump gun.
Party time!
We go visit Abdel in the hospital?
I gotta show you something... That's real steel!
Get a load of it. - What a mother!
What'll you do with it? Stop it, Hubert. What you gonna do with it?
Depends if Abdel dies. You gonna kill a cop?
Best way to get respect! Smoking a cop will get you respect? It'll even up the score.
- So don't ask! One thing's sure...
With that piece you're the big man.
Hey, wait for me!
Fuck it...
What the fuck ya doin'?
OK, don't have a shit fit!
Sorry, fellas, you can't go in.
Let us in.
We came to see Abdel.
Sorry, I have my orders.
Just a couple of minutes. Then we'll leave. He's our friend.
We won't make trouble!
If I let you in, I'll lose my job.
- Sure, flunkey!
Tone it down.
His family's here. They need peace and quiet!
We're not as good as reporters?
Get going!
Hands off, man!
You gonna make me leave?
Gonna shoot me?
Pull out your pop gun!
What's going on here?
Look at that fuckface!
We came to see our pal Abdel! We won't leave till we see him.
Beat it, before I take you in.
Oh, yeah? You shut up!
Move 'em out!
We can be nice or nasty.
It's up to you! Calm down! Lieut., these kids made trouble.
They protect you!
Who protects us from you?
Never do it again!
Who writes your jokes?
Watch your tongue!
Watch your mother!
You ever trash me again, you go to central lock-up.
Your brother can bail you out.
I didn't ask no favors. - I did it for your brother.
He'd rip you apart!
You're the ripper.
About the boxing gym:
I can get you a City grant.
You'll get another gym.
Kids want to punch more than bags now! It's hopeless.
Once I could talk to the kids. No more. And they know me!
A rookie cop wouldn't last a month. An Arab in a police station doesn't last an hour! I have to go.
OK!
You shook his hand? He's always been cool with me. You don't shake a pig's hand!
You shoot him, I shake his hand! You're a fuckin'pain!
And you're out of it!
Look!
I knew it!
You acted so weird at the hospital.
Take it easy.
- Let me see.
You didn't tell us? You didn't want to know!
Packing that! You retard!
I'm a big boy.
Quit preaching!
I'll bust your chops! Stop it! You feel big with that gun!
I'll kick your ass! Like how?
Cut it out. Let's grab a sandwich.
You shut up!
I'm splittin'.
So split!
Stay with us. Sayid, let him split! Don't go!
Back off.
What's with him?
Jerk thinks too much.
Where's Mom? - Explain this to me.
I can't now.
Well?
What's the answer? I don't know. You never know.
- OK, I never know. Hi, Mom.
How's the kid brother?
He's fine. But your brother in jail isn't so good.
What's with Max? He needs textbooks.
What for?
To get a high school diploma while he's inside.
He never made grade school!
Hands off the pots! I didn't do nothing!
I dunno how I'll buy his books.
By the way...
There's the money for the power bill.
And my machine?
- What machine?
My new sewing machine!
Shit, I forgot to ask WalMart.
Mine's ready to croak.
Patou, go study in your room.
Mom.
- Don't argue. Who's WalMart? That fence in Tower B?
It'll make granma's day!
Fuck, fuck the po-lice...
He's intense.
Killer!
A mother killer!
Sayid, check out the cow.
Fuck off with your cow!
I swear! - You said you'd cut my hair.
The same cow!
I saw it!
You're the cow!
It was the same fuckin' cow! You gotta believe me!
Shut up!
I'm Segnor Duck...
I fucka you, I fucka her, I fucka him...
OK Granma!
So they're red peppers!
You know this cow business.
It's a weird trip.
Don't wreck my hair! I gotta get laid!
So watch it! I can mow a lawn, I'll try. A lawn?
- What? A cop's piece is hot. You said that already.
I'll whack you.
Don't move.
If Abdel dies, you'll kill?
Wanna be the next Arab iced by the pigs?
Well, me neither. Well, me neither.
So now you're an Arab! They think we're full of shit.
But I'm not bullshitting about this, Sayid.
Watch it!
It's cool.
Is this gun legit for a cop?
What'd you do?
Nothing, I swear it!
Why swear? Because it's nothing. I'm cold there!
It's cold in this room!
I'll even it out, it'll be great!
I got a date! Lemme see!
No fuckin' trust!
I didn't see! You didn't look!
Trust me, dammit! It's a nice hole. A nice what?
I'm asking the questions! You should be in school. Get outta here!
You still here? Get lost!
You talk to my friends!
To Vincent.
The name's Vinz, not Vincent!
And don't talk to him! Get a move on! - Don't push!
Jason's brother's in a prize fight. Got tickets? - Freebies.
Killer! Who cut your hair, Sayid? Kids these days!
Check that!
Shit's happenin'!
Abdel's my brother, pig!
You're gonna pay! Step on it! It's stalled!
Outta the car, freeze! Drop the gun! Freeze!
Get the fuck out! Riot cops are coming!
Get back, scum!
Vinz, Hubert, this way!
This way!
Freeze!
You crazy?
Where were you? We fucked your mother!
I swear the pig was right in my sights.
I had him like I have you now!
The sucker froze, shit his pants.
Without Hubert, I'd have smoked him!
Right in the mother!
Hubert slugged him so hard he went into orbit!
No! I swear it!
Slugged a pig?
You were great!
THE WORLD IS YOURS
Now what do we do?
I gotta call to get my bucks.
Got Snoopy's address?
I'll wait, but not forever!
This cost me a $3 chocolate milk!
I'd better collect! You want some, Vinz?
Want some? - No.
You sure?
Want some, Cousin Hubie?
You're already chocolate!
Will you guys stop sulking?
Who's sulking?
Not me! Unbelievable! - Ask him!
A couple of kids! Who's the kid?
- 2 kids worrying over jackshit!
I'm 100% behind you! Wanting to kill a cop is jackshit!
Tell your buddy to back off! I never said I wanted to. Yes, you did!
Yes! - No! I didn't say that!
I said if Abdel died, I'd smoke a cop. Not for the hell of it!
Expect us to bring you gifts in jail?
I expect nothing!
Not from a guy who kisses cop ass! Go ahead, laugh!
Laugh! I'm fuckin' sick of the goddam system!
We live in rat holes, you do fuck-all to change things! Neither do you! You're my homeys, so I'll tell you:
If Abdel dies, I hit back. I'll whack a pig!
So they know we don't turn the other cheek now! Wow, what a speech! Half Moses, half Mickey Mouse.
Forget it, Vinz. You're out of your league. If Abdel dies, we lose a friend?
If a cop dies, do all cops go away? You're just one guy!
You can't blow 'em all away! Who made you a preacher? You know what's right and wrong?
Why do you side with the assholes? Who's the asshole? In school we learnt that hate breeds hate!
I didn't go to school, I'm from the street!
Know what it taught me?
Turn the other cheek, you're dead mothafucka! Bullshit!
You pointed a gun at a cop! We coulda been killed! Nothing like a good shit!
You believe in God? That's the wrong question. Does God believe in us?
I once had a friend called Grunwalski. We were sent to Siberia together.
When you go to a Siberian work camp, you travel in a cattle car.
You roll across icy steppes for days, without seeing a soul. You huddle to keep warm.
But it's hard to relieve yourself, to take a shit, you can't do it on the train, and the only time the train stops is to take on water for the locomotive.
But Grunwalski was shy.
Even when we bathed together, he got upset.
I used to kid him about it.
So, the train stops and everyone jumps out to shit on the tracks.
I'd teased Grunwalski so much that he went off on his own.
The train Starts moving, so everyone jumps on, because it waits for nobody.
Grunwalski had a problem:
He'd gone behind a bush and was still shitting.
So I see him come out from behind the bush, holding up his pants with his hands.
I hold out my hand, but each time he reaches for it he lets go of his pants and they drop to his ankles.
He pulls them back up,
Starts running again, but they fall back down, when he reaches out for me.
Grunwalski... froze to death.
Good day.
Why'd he tell us that?
I got the address.
I'll call you.
Why'd he tell us that?
'Xcuse me, I'm just out of the hospital.
I haven't eaten for 2 days. My child's hungry, I need your spare change...
I wanna date with Mina!
I'll lasso her!
What d'you want?
My dad's in jail, my mom's in jail, my whole family is!
Get a job like everyone else! What is this, Mardi Gras? I want Mina!
I'm homeless, my welfare ran out.
I got out of a halfway house...
It's a block away. Thanks.
Have a nice day, sir.
Thanks.
The pigs are fuckin' polite around here!
Even called me sir!
Maybe he won the lottery!
Damn, it's locked!
What's his real name?
I only know him as Snoopy.
Yes?
- Sorry to bother you.
I'm looking for...
Snoopy. It sounds weird.
- Very funny! The fucker hung up.
You try.
Why me? - Try! Darkie and me will get shot at!
Hello. - Yes?
Is Snoopy there?
No, but Charlie Brown is!
You fucked it up, you asshole!
Stop that! Sorry to bother you.
Our pal Snoopy lives here, we don't know his real name.
Stop ringing! You thinka da world is yours?
Unreal!
No, we're staying!
So call the cops, you spic!
Sayid?
Snoopy? What floor? - 5th.
We're coming!
Snoopy? Is no name!
You always make a trouble!
Were you followed?
- No. No one?
- Nobody! You sure? - Why?
Because...
You cool?
Great! Check that kitchen.
Who's this dude?
Nice space!
You win the lottery?
A guy loaned it to me.
He ain't gettin' it back!
This is no apartment, it's a palace!
I don't believe it. Bitchin' apartment!
Snoopy, meet Vinz.
This is Cousin Hubert! We've met before!
Line of coke? - No. You sure?
A little line of coke?
No one for coke? How's your bro? - OK.
Mean fuckin' dude! He still a maniac? - And you?
Fuckin' A!
Watch! So you got my cash? My bread!
Make it snappy, Snoopy!
Cut the bullshit!
Come get it.
Comin' at you, Bruce Lee!
Hands off! - What? Not for kids!
So what?
I got a piece too.
Let's see! Whip it out.
Fuck!
Don't, Vinz! He knows guns.
A snub-nosed Smith &amp; Wesson Magnum 44.
Watch it!
It's loaded.
Mean piece.
You're a gangsta.
It's for self-defense.
You into magic? Watch.
One bullet. I missed.
You're nuts! That's live ammo!
- It's an old trick!
Cool it.
We up the stakes:
2 bullets!
Snoopy!
Wiggin' out, guys?
You're nuts.
Gimme!
Your turn.
Let's go, he's fried.
Gonna do it? Gimme.
- Do it! I did it, you do it!
Man, you want trouble?
Do it!
Chill, guys!
Stop, Vinz!
You aiming at me?
You're off your head!
You bet I'm aiming at you!
No one fucks with me! I'm not some ass-wipe! Wanna see a gun?
A fuckin' gun?
Sayid, get him out!
We're outta here!
Up your mother's slash, sucker!
Look! That's right, asshole! He was bluffing!
In my 'hood, the cops come a week after you're dead!
Hey, you! You together?
- I don't know them.
Why you here? I live with my aunt! What's her name?
Mrs. Zyl...
Got I.D.?
- I'm on the level...
Easy! Freeze!
Don't move, boy! You know him?
Who? - Your pal.
I don't know him.
We'll see about that, wise guy!
This is humiliating! - Too bad.
What's this?
Good stuff!
I'm keeping it.
Afghan's the best.
Good buzz going up and down. Same with Black Bombay.
Lebanese can really vary.
This is crap but I'll keep it...
Well? The little fucker outran me.
Take them in. Get in the back.
- Why me?
Get in!
Listen, scumbag.
You know what I think of you?
You're like poodle shit on a sidewalk.
I can't take a step without squashing your ugly dog-turd face.
So watch where the dog dumps you!
You're all alone!
Far from the slums... and your looter pals. Pick it up with your feet. Like your people do back home.
OK, there's no big hurry.
In 2 hours, they may be free.
Make the most of it.
How 'bout a bullet in the back of your head? A nice little bullet? You gotta stop in time.
Don't touch him! You know this one?
The Shanghai Squeeze.
It's an oldie.
Wait, I think he's thirsty. Fucker! Don't hurt yourself!
But it's hard to stop in time.
You gotta stay in control.
That's the trick. I like his face.
He's cute.
What was the name?
Are you cute?
- Yes! I'm cute! I'm cute!
The little guy's excited.
Leave him alone!
It's so easy to go too far! But you mustn't!
Though you're dying to!
Right, you Arab sonofabitch?
OK, let's go.
Sir! We'll miss the last train! Forget it.
Did I talk to you?
Yo, Vinz! Where's Sayid and Hubert? Dunno.
You guys are always fussin'!
Your sister's hot.
Shut up, asshole.
Sorry, but she's hot. You don't stand a chance.
Don't you try. Don't even look at her!
Check the turn! I won't try 'cause she's pregnant.
Don't diss my sis', butthead!
Brothers, I gotta make it by any means necessary
'cos my mind's playin' tricks on me.
You won't let us in?
Beat it!
That nigger bouncer never lets us in!
We know his bro for 10 years!
And he still gives us shit!
Drives me crazy! What's up with the flare gun? Where you going?
Don't be a hot dog! Stop! I told you I'd be back!
Not so big now, fuckface! You and your stinkin' club!
Fuck your club! Goddam nigger!
That cop made us miss it.
Dickless fuckin' Tracy!
When's the next one?
Tomorrow morning.
How much did Snoopy owe you?
What? What'd he owe you?
One. $1,000?
What? All this shit for a lousy $100!
It's the principle that counts.
Principle!
Coyote's a bad motherfucker.
Roadrunner's a pussy.
Pick between Tweetie and Sylvester.
Fuck you and Tweetie!
I don't take shit from a guy who sees cows!
I say Sylvester's the real gangsta.
Bottom line!
'Nuff said! Can't talk with you guys if you won't listen.
'Cause you listen?
You got it all wrong.
I say Tweetie's the baddest. He always wins.
That's bullshit!
Sylvester fucks Tweetie and you!
Come again?
Who does he fuck? Me?
Anyway, Sylvester's a black brother.
A black brother? Full of shit!
Shall we, gentlemen?
What can we lose?
It's positively frightful!
Is this guy famous?
He will be when he grows up!
There's Champagne, Cinzano, Bogardi...
I don't drink.
- I mean Bacardi. Outta my way.
I want peanuts.
Cheers, Charles!
Hey, Charles!
Behave, asshole!
Let 'em through, Sayid!
Check out the babes!
That's what I call women!
The sister is hot.
Do me a favor. I'm not going!
Who bought the tacos last week?
You owe me one. Get me the sister.
Awright.
There's just two!
Who cares? - Shut up!
Get her for me, Hubert!
Excuse me, my name's Hubert.
My friend's a romantic, he's really shy.
He'd love to meet you.
That's him.
What d'ya say? Look what you did to me!
He's really cool. He's too nice. - OK, then!
C'mon Sayid!
Hold this.
Haven't we met before?
Don't I wish! Hi, girls!
I'm Sayid.
Please don't lean on the painting. You're the painting! I'm good at what?
What about?
Lighten up! We were ready to talk, but with your attitude, how can we respect you?
Who are you? The Wonderbra bitch? Who asked you?
What are you staring at? Got a screw loose? You're the screw.
Stop! - What's wrong with you? Leave us alone, we didn't ask you over!
Gentlemen, please!
It's cool, Pops!
Nobody's been hurt! What's your beef?
Keep your heads, please.
- Please what? Let's go!
Pretty please!
Let's all calm down! Stop that! Stop your friend.
You're not my friend! Fuck you!
Know what? Go suck cocks in hell!
With your mothers!
- You're all ugly!
I'm fuckin' sorry, sir!
Have fun, mothafuckas!
Troubled youth!
We shoulda swiped a bottle.
I got the sucker's charge card!
Hubert!
Up to your old tricks! Like riding a bike:
You don't forget.
Mr. David Moe?
He's not here?
We keep it for him!
Give it to me. What's the score?
Killer!
Know what I'm saying?
Your name's not David!
And cabs don't take plastic.
Just this once.
Gimme a break!
You fart? It was you. Who else?
It stinks. Had to be you. That's not my stink.
I know your farts. Mothafucka, we're locked out.
Who farted? He did. - He did.
Can't you tell?
It was him.
Your ass reeks.
Motherfucking goddam steering wheel!
Cut the poetry and pull the thing!
Jean-Claude does this in five seconds flat.
Which Jean-Claude? The mailman?
No, that's Sylvie's boyfriend.
This guy got 2 years for car theft.
Move it, bust the fucker!
Use your foot!
Don't be a sissy.
Who's a sissy?
Relax, Max.
"Night of the Living Car!"
The wipers!
Rip open that plastic box.
Open sesame!
Connect the green wire to the red one.
Nah, that's for the blinkers.
How'd they do it in on TV?
Fuck TV!
Start the mother!
Who the fuck's he?
Freaked me out!
Who the fuck are you? Huh?
- What you doin'? Nothing.
So go somewhere else. Move, you'll get us nabbed.
It's my wife...
What about her?
She left me.
Do we fuckin' care?
Don't wait for the law, Start it. Move!
The red wire to the green wire.
Lay off, that's for the horn! Try the blue, jerk!
You do it! If you're so smart.
I'll kill you!! You're a drag. That wire's for the horn.
No, that's the horn! Sayid's right.
You see? Who was right?
We do it my way! Gimme some metal! Move it!
You're a good guy. What's your name?
You got a name?
At least we put it to good use! Ready?
Watch this.
Anyone know how to drive?
Vinz does.
- Wait a second.
I never learned, I got no licence. He does. He was in the Army.
The Navy! I can't drive. I can!
You took that bitch around Israel in a Mercedes. Not the same thing! That was different.
More like a dream! You guys are so lame! Now what?
Sorry, but a cop car's coming. Where?
- That's a cop car. It's real close.
On three, we're outta here, OK? Ready? Three!
Freeze!
Out of the way!
Sometimes you feel so fuckin' small... Got any more bullshit wisdom? "The early bird catches the worm."
Spray cans! - You're the can! What was that old guy in the john trying to say?
I see skinheads. You're the skinhead. Fuck Nazis!
Out of the way.
Vinz, Know the one about the guy falling off a skyscraper? On the way down he says to himself: "So far so good... so far so good..."
Like us in the projects.
So far so good, but how will we land?
I feel like an ant lost in intergalactic space.
Watch, I'll switch off the Eiffel Tower.
That only works in movies.
Mothafucka!
You in a movie?
In a porn flick with your mother!
Look who's talking!
Yours sticks carrots up her ass!
You're the carrot!
THE WORLD IS YOURS
THE WORLD IS OURS
How did they get the car in the gym? Search me... Ask God!
Very funny.
Look at those sheep in the system.
They look cute in their fancy leather jackets.
But they're scumbags. They ride escalators, carried by the system. They vote far right, but aren't racists.
They can't move without escalators.
The worst!
Racist!
WAR IN BOSNlA
ABDEL ICHAHA DlES
Where's Vinz?
Mothafucka!
What? Dumb fuck! What did I do?
Please. Help you what? What'd I do?
You wanna kill a pig, go right ahead. But you're on your own.
We're outta here.
Get lost.
Both of you!
I don't need you!
I know who I am and where I come from!
So go home and shut up!
Fuck your mother!
Don't bug me, Sayid.
Think we should've...
Just what we need! A nigger! You're the fucker who dissed us from the roof!
Let's see you fight!
Hold him!
Come back! You fuckin' asshole! I done nothing!
Get the fuck in there!
Whatcha gonna do?
You think I'm all talk?
I'm all talk?
Watch! Don't try and stop me! Vinz, don't do it!
Shoot! Shoot!
Let's see if we can figure out 3 times 60. Well, there's a couple of ways you could think about it.
You could literally view this as 60 three times, so you could view this as 60 plus 60 plus 60. And you might be able compute this in your head. 60 plus 60 is 120, plus another 60 is 180.
So, let's say we want to multiply 50 times 7. And I encourage you to pause the video and think about it yourself and then unpause and see what I do.
Well, there's a couple of ways you could think about it. One: You could literally try to add 50 seven times.
50 plus 50 plus 50 plus 50 (let's see... that's four) plus 50 plus 50 (let's see... that is 6, I'll do one more right over here) plus 50. So this is 50 seven times. 50 plus 50 is 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350.
In our last video, we looked the simple designs of beam and arch bridges. Now let's move into the modern age for the truss bridge Truss bridges make use of a large frame called the truss.
You can see that the largest loads are on the end and top segments but the middle segments have not. Remember that when we do the compression test spoiler alert! Let's see if this convict can shut off this truss jail.
we cannot factor out a 4 since 15 is not divisible by 4. we must factor by grouping. look for 2 numbers whose product equals the product of 4 and -15 their sum needs to be equal to positive 4 the first clue is the product of the numbers is negative, so a and b must have different signs but a + b is equal to 4 so, the difference of their absolute values must equal 4
let's think about all of the factors of -60 6 band 10 look tantalizing since they are 4 apart we want them to add to positive 4, so larger number must be positive so, we want positive 10 and negative 6 now, group first 2 terms now, group the second 2 terms. both are divisible by 5 factor out a 2y now, factor out a 5
Philip: I'm Philip Rosedale. I think entrepreneurs just love the spotlight in many cases; a lot more than the actual money.
Let's see if we can write 0.36 as a fraction. The way I like to do it is to say, well, 0.36, this is the same thing as 36 hundredths.
"We now know a little bit about inflation, deflation. Now I want to introduce you to hyper, hyperinflation, and as the word implies, it's inflation gone wild. And the general idea how hyperinflation, or at least the cases that we've seen in modern times, how they've happened, is you have some type of a government just going wild with the printing press, they're just printing a ton of money.
But they just printed money like crazy. Some people said that they were almost trying to destroy the economy so that they wouldn't have to pay reparations for what they did in World War I. But this just gives you a sense of how crazy it was, here's the end of World War I, and they just printed money like mad and the inflation, it was pretty -it was- this isn't the rate of inflation, this is how much was it relative to a gold mark, so this is one gold mark, over here.
So by, only after about two and a half years it was over ten fold. And this is a logarithmic scale. Each slash-year, this a factor of ten.
And once again this a logarithmic scale, this is ten to the 30th power. And then the largest or the most extreme hyperinflation ever was Hungary after World War Il, and this right here is a ten million pin go note, just to give you an idea of what people were carrying around their pockets."
My goal in this video and the next video is to start giving a sense of the scale of (really, just) the Earth and the solar system, and as we see as we start getting into (like) the galaxy and the universe it just becomes almost impossible to imagine but we'll at least give our best shot. So I think most of us watching this video know that this right here is Earth. This right here is Earth.
Every cell in the human body needs energy to survive and do its different functions, if we are talking about our brain cell it needs energy to keep stimulating other brain cells and sending on signals and messages. If it's muscle cell it needs energy to contract they need energy just to do the basic function of a cell and the place where they get that energy from or the primary source of that energy is from glucose, and glucose is a simple sugar. if you actually tasted glucose, it would taste sweet.
So our Pancreas is producing insulin and putting it into our bloodstream, so it's there to be used. but a situation can arise where the receptors are not working properly, and they have been desensitized to insulin. In this situation, the receptors have difficulty binding to the insulin. and glucose does not enter the cell. Thus, in either one of these scenarios and let's just think in a broad sense.
For me they normally happen, these career crises, often, actually, on a Sunday evening, just as the sun is starting to set, and the gap between my hopes for myself and the reality of my life starts to diverge so painfully that I normally end up weeping into a pillow. I'm mentioning all this -- I'm mentioning all this because I think this is not merely a personal problem; you may think I'm wrong in this, but I think we live in an age when our lives are regularly punctuated by career crises, by moments when what we thought we knew -- about our lives, about our careers -- comes into contact with a threatening sort of reality.
It leads, in the worst cases -- in the analysis of a sociologist like Emil Durkheim -- it leads to increased rates of suicide. There are more suicides in developed, individualistic countries than in any other part of the world. And some of the reason for that is that people take what happens to them extremely personally -- they own their success, but they also own their failure.
I'm drawn to a lovely quote by St. Augustine in "The City of God," where he says, "It's a sin to judge any man by his post." In modern English that would mean it's a sin to come to any view of who you should talk to, dependent on their business card. It's not the post that should count.
According to St. Augustine, only God can really put everybody in their place; he's going to do that on the Day of Judgment, with angels and trumpets, and the skies will open. Insane idea, if you're a secularist person, like me. But something very valuable in that idea, nevertheless.
Chris Anderson: That was fascinating. But how do you reconcile this idea of it being bad to think of someone as a "loser," with the idea that a lot of people like, of seizing control of your life, and that a society that encourages that, perhaps has to have some winners and losers?
Alain De Botton: Yes, I think it's merely the randomness of the winning and losing process that I want to stress, because the emphasis nowadays is so much on the justice of everything, and politicians always talk about justice. Now I'm a firm believer in justice, I just think that it's impossible.
That's what I'm trying to leave room for; otherwise, it can get quite claustrophobic. I mean, do you believe that you can combine your kind of kinder, gentler philosophy of work with a successful economy?
We need fathers, as it were, the exemplary father figures in society, avoiding the two extremes, which is the authoritarian disciplinarian on the one hand, and on the other, the lax, no-rules option.
CA: Alain De Botton.
AB: Thank you very much. (Applause)
For tens of thousands of years, Homo sapiens lived throughout Africa, but only some of these people were our ancestors.
By 60,000 years ago, our ancestors were on the move, and their expansions started to have staying power,
we don't know how fast, or how far they traveled. Today, hunter-gatherer groups move, on average, about 1 km a year, it's about half mile. But it's not always consistent--what we do know is this, as their descendants moved into new environments, they became more isolated from one another, setting the stage for the high level of genetic diversity that we see in Africa today.
Maybe a genetic change in a population allowed some people to express more complex concepts through language, and so to out-compete those who couldn't, no one really knows. Around 50,000 years ago, small groups of travelers crossed into Asia, possibly as few as a hundred people in all. Everyone alive today who has any non-African ancestors is probably descended from these travelers.
By 45,000 years ago, people were living in parts of Australia and making their mark. In order to get there, they had to cross the 90 km--that's about 50 miles--of open water which separates Australia from the nearest islands of present-day Indonesia. Just how this was done, no one knows.
In the last video I hinted that things were about to get wacky, and they are! So if we start where we left off in the last video, we started right over here, looking at the distance to the nearest star and, just a reminder in this drawing right here this depiction right here this circle right here this solar system circle, its not the size of the sun, its not the size of the orbits of the Earth or Pluto or the Kuiper belt this is close to the size of the Oort cloud.
The actual orbit of earth is about one, well the diameter of the orbit of earth is about one fifty thousandth of this so you wouldn't even see it on this. it wouldn't even make up a pixel on this screen right here, much less the actual size of the sun or something much smaller. And just remember that orbit of the earth that was at a huge distance. It takes 8 mins for light to get from the sun to the earth.
Thank you very much. I moved to America 12 years ago with my wife Terry and our two kids. Actually, truthfully, we moved to Los Angeles -- (Laughter) thinking we were moving to America, but anyway -- (Laughter)
like, "Americans don't get irony." (Laughter) Have you come across this idea?
like, "The British are reserved." (Laughter) I don't know why people think this.
Like, "Which one are you? Remind me." (Laughter)
"Your mother and I need some color-coding system so we don't get confused."
Education under "No Child Left Behind" is based on not diversity but conformity. What schools are encouraged to do is to find out what kids can do across a very narrow spectrum of achievement.
One of the effects of "No Child Left Behind" has been to narrow the focus onto the so-called STEM disciplines.
They're very important. I'm not here to argue against science and math. On the contrary, they're necessary but they're not sufficient.
ADHD. I'm not saying there's no such thing. I just don't believe it's an epidemic like this.
You can say, "There's Deborah, she's in room 34, she's teaching." But if nobody's learning anything, she may be engaged in the task of teaching but not actually fulfilling it. The role of a teacher is to facilitate learning.
"Your cholesterol is what I call Level Orange."
"Really?" (Laughter)
"Is that good?" "We don't know." (Laughter) But all that should support learning.
(Laughter) And sit staring out the window with a bottle of Jack Daniels. (Laughter)
"Would you like to come for a walk?"
"No, I'm fine." (Laughter)
"You go. I'll wait. But take pictures."
The third thing -- and I was at a meeting recently with some people from Finland, actual Finnish people, and somebody from the American system was saying to the people in Finland, "What do you do about the drop-out rate in Finland?" And they all looked a bit bemused, and said,
"Well, we don't have one. Why would you drop out? If people are in trouble, we get to them quite quickly and we help and support them."
"Well, you know, you can't compare Finland to America." No. I think there's a population of around five million in Finland.
Many states in America have fewer people in them than that. I mean, I've been to some states in America and I was the only person there. (Laughter)
(Applause ends) So I think we have to embrace a different metaphor. We have to recognize that it's a human system, and there are conditions under which people thrive, and conditions under which they don't.
"There are three sorts of people in the world: Those who are immovable, people who don't get it, or don't want to do anything about it; there are people who are movable, people who see the need for change and are prepared to listen to it; and there are people who move, people who make things happen." And if we can encourage more people, that will be a movement.
Mary wants the fraction of pink blocks in Model B to be equivalent to the fraction of pink blocks in Model A.
How many blocks in Model B need to be pink in order to make that happen? So let's look at Model A. So how many equal sections are there?
Model B is the exact same length as Model A.
And so for every block that you have in Model A, for every block here, you must have four in Model B. Because we went from five sections to twenty. So we're essentially multiplying by 4.
If we were to just draw a line right down here you'd see that for every block in Model A you have 1, 2, 3, 4 blocks in Model B.
So one block in Model A that is with pink would be the same thing as four blocks in Model B. We would literally just multiply this times 4. So four of the twenty will need to be made pink.
I know what you're thinking. You think I've lost my way, and somebody's going to come on the stage in a minute and guide me gently back to my seat. (Applause)
I get that all the time in Dubai. "Here on holiday are you, dear?" (Laughter)
"Come to visit the children?
How long are you staying?" Well actually, I hope for a while longer yet. I have been living and teaching in the Gulf for over 30 years.
I was recruited by the British Council, along with about 25 other teachers. And we were the first non-Muslims to teach in the state schools there in Kuwait. We were brought to teach English because the government wanted to modernize the country and to empower the citizens through education.
After all, the best education -- according to the latest World University Rankings -- is to be found in the universities of the U.K. and the U.S. So everybody wants to have an English education, naturally. But if you're not a native speaker, you have to pass a test.
Now let me put it this way: if I met a monolingual Dutch speaker who had the cure for cancer, would I stop him from entering my British University? I don't think so. But indeed, that is exactly what we do.
"But," I hear you say,
"what about the research? It's all in English." So the books are in English, the journals are done in English, but that is a self-fulfilling prophecy.
Case in point, Einstein. He, by the way, was considered remedial at school because he was, in fact, dyslexic. But fortunately for the world, he did not have to pass an English test.
"Those fees aren't bad, they're okay," but they are prohibitive to so many millions of poor people. So immediately, we're rejecting them. (Applause)
"Education: The Great Divide." Now I get it,
This is -- I don't know if you saw it on CNN recently -- they gave the Heroes Award to a young Kenyan shepherd boy who couldn't study at night in his village, like all the village children, because the kerosene lamp, it had smoke and it damaged his eyes. And anyway, there was never enough kerosene, because what does a dollar a day buy for you?
"The children can lead Africa from what it is today, a dark continent, to a light continent." A simple idea, but it could have such far-reaching consequences. People who have no light, whether it's physical or metaphorical, cannot pass our exams, and we can never know what they know.
Round 423,275 to the nearest thousand. So let me rewrite it: 423,275.
As a magician, I'm always interested in performances that incorporate elements of illusion. And one of the most remarkable was the tanagra theater, which was popular in the early part of the 20th century. It used mirrors to create the illusion of tiny people performing on a miniature stage.
Nikola Tesla. Now the baby grew into a very smart guy. Let me show you.
Tesla, what is 236 multiplied by 501?
Nikola Tesla: The result is 118,236.
Marco Tempest: Now Tesla's brain worked in the most extraordinary way. When a word was mentioned, an image of it instantly appeared in his mind.
Tesla created his inventions in his mind.
NT: To my delight, I discovered I could visualize my inventions with the greatest facility.
And when they worked in the vivid playground of his imagination, he would build them in his workshop.
NT: I needed no models, drawings or experiments. I could picture them as real in my mind, and there I run it, test it and improve it.
His great idea was alternating current.
NT: We are at the dawn of a new age, the age of electricity. I have been able, through careful invention, to transmit, with the mere flick of a switch, electricity across the ether.
Tesla has over 700 patents to his name: radio, wireless telegraphy, remote control, robotics. He even photographed the bones of the human body.
But the high point was the realization of a childhood dream: harnessing the raging powers of Niagara Falls, and bringing light to the city. But Tesla's success didn't last.
NT: I had bigger ideas. Illuminating the city was only the beginning.
A world telegraphy center -- imagine news, messages, sounds, images delivered to any point in the world instantly and wirelessly. MT: It's a great idea; it was a huge project.
NT:
They wouldn't give me the money. MT: Well, maybe you shouldn't have told them it could be used to contact other planets.
NT: Yes, that was a big mistake.
MT:
Tesla's career as an inventor never recovered. He became a recluse. Dodged by death, he spent much of his time in his suite at the Waldorf-Astoria.
NT: Everything I did, I did for mankind, for a world where there would be no humiliation of the poor by the violence of the rich, where products of intellect, science and art will serve society for the betterment and beautification of life.
MT:
Nikola Tesla died on the 7th of January, 1943.
His final resting place is a golden globe that contains his ashes at the Nikola Tesla Museum in Belgrade. His legacy is with us still.
Tesla became the man who lit the world, but this was only the beginning. Tesla's insight was profound.
Tell me, what will man do when the forests disappear, and the coal deposits are exhausted?
MT: Tesla thought he had the answer. We are still asking the question.
Near the end of the last video, I wasn't as articulate as I would like to be. Mainly because I think 15 minutes into a video my brain starts to really warm up too much. But what I want to do is restate what I was trying to say.
I'm going to tell you about an affliction I suffer from. And I have a funny feeling that quite a few of you suffer from it as well. When I'm walking around an art gallery, rooms and rooms full of paintings, after about 15 or 20 minutes,
"Girl with a Pearl Earring" by Johannes Vermeer, 17th-century Dutch painter. This is the most glorious painting. I first saw it when I was 19, and I immediately went out and got a poster of it, and in fact I still have that poster.
In fact, we don't know who any of the models in any of Vermeer's paintings are, and we know very little about Vermeer himself. Which made me go, "Yippee!" I can do whatever I want, I can come up with whatever story I want to.
How does Vermeer know her? Well, there've been suggestions that she is his 12-year-old daughter. The daughter at the time was 12 when he painted the painting.
It would have been inappropriate for Vermeer to paint his daughter like that. So it's not his daughter, but it's somebody close to him, physically close to him. Well, who else would be in the house?
We don't know very much about Vermeer, but the little bits that we do know, one thing we know is that he married a Catholic woman, they lived with her mother in a house where he had his own room where he -- his studio. He also had 11 children. It would have been a chaotic, noisy household.
The next painting I'm going to talk about is called "Boy Building a House of Cards" by Chardin. He's an 18th-century French painter best known for his still lifes, but he did occasionally paint people. And in fact, he painted four versions of this painting, different boys building houses of cards, all concentrated.
like Goldilocks's porridge, is just right. He's not quite a child, and he's not quite a man. He's absolutely balanced between innocence and experience, and that made me stop in my tracks in front of this painting.
"Look at me. Please look at me." And he didn't look at me.
The last painting I'm going to talk about is called "Anonymous" by anonymous. (Laughter) This is a Tudor portrait bought by the National Portrait Gallery.
They thought it was a man named Sir Thomas Overbury, and then they discovered that it wasn't him, and they have no idea who it is. Now, in the National Portrait Gallery, if you don't know the biography of the painting, it's kind of useless to you. They can't hang it on the wall, because they don't know who he is.
"Rosy"
I am still wearing the white brocade doublet Caroline gave me. It has a plain high collar, detachable sleeves and intricate buttons of twisted silk thread, set close together so that the fit is snug. The doublet makes me think of a coverlet on the vast bed.
As a boy, I was teased by my sisters and by schoolboys, but not by George.
Only George could call me Rosy. I would not allow anyone else. He managed to make the word tender.
"What do you think of my doublet?" I asked. He glanced at me. "That collar looks to be strangling you."
"We can still hunt and play cards and attend court. Nothing need change."
George did not speak.
"I am 23 years old. It is time for me to marry and produce an heir. It is expected of me."
George drained another glass of claret and turned to me.
"Congratulations on your upcoming nuptials, James. I'm sure you'll be content together." He never used my nickname again.
I have the answer to a question that we've all asked. The question is,
Why is it that the letter X represents the unknown? Now I know we learned that in math class, but now it's everywhere in the culture --
The X prize, the X-Files,
Project X, TEDx. Where'd that come from? About six years ago
"the system for reconciling disparate parts." Al-jebr finally came into English as algebra. One example among many.
This is the letter SHeen, and it makes the sound we think of as SH -- "sh." It's also the very first letter of the word shalan, which means "something" just like the the English word "something" -- some undefined, unknown thing. Now in Arabic, we can make this definite by adding the definite article "al."
The problem for the Medieval Spanish scholars who were tasked with translating this material is that the letter SHeen and the word shalan can't be rendered into Spanish because Spanish doesn't have that SH, that "sh" sound.
So by convention, they created a rule in which they borrowed the CK sound, "ck" sound, from the classical Greek in the form of the letter Kai. Later when this material was translated into a common European language, which is to say Latin, they simply replaced the Greek Kai with the Latin X. And once that happened, once this material was in Latin, it formed the basis for mathematics textbooks for almost 600 years.
X is the unknown because you can't say "sh" in Spanish. (Laughter) And I thought that was worth sharing.
 What number could replace this weird circle with an x symbol looking thing below? And over here, they have this equation.
By the end of 1923, Hitler sees it as his chance to seize power in Germany.
Up until the 1970's, cryptography had been based on symmetric keys. That is, the sender encrypts their message using a specific key and the receiver decrypts using an identical key. As you may recall, encryption is a mapping from some message, using a specific key, to a cyphertext message.
Now she'll have to manage all of these keys and send thousands of messages just to establish them. Could there be a simpler way?
In 1970 James Ellis a British engineer and mathematician was working on an idea for non-secret encryption. It's based on a simple yet clever concept. Lock and unlock are inverse operations.
And she now only needs to keep track of a single key.
Ellis never arrived at a mathematical solution, though he added an intuitive sense of how it should work. The idea is based on splitting a key into two parts: an encryption key and a decryption key. The decryption key performs the inverse or undo operation, which was applied by the encryption key.
Alice first generates her private key by randomly selecting a colour, say red. Next, assume Alice uses a secret colour machine to find the exact complement of her red, and nobody else has acces to this. This results in cyan, which she sends to Bob as her public key.
I thought I would do few examples using the angle bisector theorem. So, in the first triangle right over here, we are given that this side has length three; this side has length six and this little dotted line here, this is clearly the angle bisector because they are telling us this angle is congruent to that angle right over there and than they tell us the length of just this part of this side right over here is 2. So from here to here is 2 and that this length is x. let's figure out what x is.
So the angle bisector theorem tells us that the ratio of 3 to 2 is going to be equal to 6 to x. So we can just solve for x. so 3 to 2 is going to be equal to 6. to x and than once again you can cross multiply or you multiply both sides by 2 and x. kind of gives you the same result.
If you cross multiply, you get 3x 3x equal to, 2 times 3 is 12. x is equal to, divide both sides by 3, x is equal to 4. So in this case, x is equal to 4. and this is kind of interesting, because we just realized now that this side, this entire side right over here is going to be equal to 6. So even thought, it doesn't look that way based on the way, its drawn.
Let me do this in a new color, the ratio of 5 to x is going to be equal to ratio of 7 to this distance, right over here and what is that distance?
So if the whole is 10, and this is x, than this distance right over here is going to be 10 -x So the ratio of 5 to x, is equal to 7 over 10 minus x, and we can cross multiply Multiply 5 times 10 minus x is 50 minus is 5x and than 7 times x is equal to 7x minus 5x and than x times 7 is equal to 7x.
Add 5x to both sides of the equation. You get 50 is equal to 12x divide both sides by 12 and we get 50 over 12 is equal to x So we can reduce this, let's see if you divide numerator and denominator by 2
I'm a designer and an educator. I'm a multitasking person, and I push my students to fly through a very creative, multitasking design process. But how efficient is, really, this multitasking?
Man: Hi. I want you to meet my friend Shoshana.
Is Mars really red? When you see Mars in the night sky, it definitely has a reddish tint to it. People have been noticing that for a long time.
The whole process of natural selection is to some degree dependent on the idea of variation, that within any population of a species, you have some genetic variation. So, for example, let's say I have a bunch of-- well, this is a circle species, and one guy is that color, and then I got a bunch more, maybe some are that color-- oh, that's the same color-- that one, and that one, and that one. And for whatever reason, sometimes there are no environmental factors that will predispose one of these guys to be able to survive and reproduce over the other, but every now and then, there might be some environmental factor, and it makes maybe, all of a sudden, this guy more fit to reproduce.
You can ride your bike 1/5 of a mile per minute. If it takes you 3 and 1/3 minutes to get to your friend's house, how many miles away does your friend live? And this here is pictures of these guys on bicycles.
When did you first hear about "Sal Khan" or "Khan Academy"?
In Google's case we were looking for approaches that were new in education. Many many people think they're doing something new, but they're not really changing the approach. Which with Sal, he said "what we are going to do is not only we're gonna make these interesting ten minute videos, but we are going to measure whether it works or not"
So here a guy who is willing to say if I'm wrong, I'm wrong, and I'm gonna keep changing until I get it right. Google has a lot of different projects. Why this one?
Google is very successful because of America.
Because of the american R&amp;D system, because of the quality of our graduates etc. America's not gonna go back to be a low wage manufacturing country, we're going to be a country of advanced manufacturing, sophisticated services, global brands. All of those require higher order reasoning skills which might be better taught using the Khan Academy approach.
Compare the expressions on both sides of the question marks. So on the left-hand side of the question mark, I have 7,907. So, it's 7,000 plus 900 plus 7, which is going to be the same thing as 7,907.
We are drowning in news.
Reuters alone puts out three and a half million news stories a year. That's just one source. My question is:
It's a project by The Long Now Foundation, which was founded by TEDsters including Kevin Kelly and Stewart Brand. And what we're looking for is news stories that might still matter 50 or 100 or 10,000 years from now.
They've overtaken the U.S. as the world's biggest car market, they've overtaken Germany as the largest exporter, and they've started doing DNA tests on kids to choose their careers. We're finding all kinds of ways to push back the limits of what we know. Some recent discoveries:
[Sounds of robots whirring and kids reacting to their successes and failures]

ANOTHER STUDENT: [Indistinct] is back in action!
ANOTHER STUDENT: No!
Your observable traits also known as your phenotypes result from the interaction between your genes and the environment.
This interaction begins in the womb and continues throughout your life. Differences in some phenotypes, like height, are determined mostly by genes. If you had short parents and grandparents you probably don't tower over your peers.
How genes influence your personality is less understood. You can now learn about over a million SNPs in your genome all at once. And every day, scientists are learning more and more about how some of these SNPs affect your phenotype.
Ben:
My name is Ben Milne, I'm CEO of a company called Dwolla and Dwolla's kind of core purpose in life is to allow anybody with an internet connection secure access to their money and allow them to exchange it with anybody else who can receive it without paying interchange costs. I had another company before and essentially all the product we sold we sold online. I was losing about 55,000 dollars a year in credit card fees and I started getting really obsessed with how I could get paid through my website without paying credit card fees.
The transaction costs will never come down and the security will never get better and the problem that we see will never be solved by utilizing anything that currently exists.
So now we just have to go build it and figure out the moving pieces. Dwolla is a pretty straight forward business model. When you use Dwolla you pay for what you do on Dwolla.
Rick:
Sal: Right, and right now, we have so many, you know, the stock market goes down every day, and people are having foreclosures, and banks are stopping lending and they're failing, so it's really hard for people to keep track of what is the problem. Are these just causes of the problem, or are they the actual problem?
Drew a little diagram here, and I think there's a basic fundamental question that we all have to ask, and what does the financial system do?
They make a lot of money. Hopefully they add some value to our economy, and this diagram essentially explains what the financial system does, so in a capitalist economy, you have a lot of people with capital. That could be land.
Why is that piece broken? Draw that one up for us. Sal:
Sure, and here I'm going to attempt to give everyone a 5-minute MBA, but essentially, what I've drawn here is our balance sheets for some banks, and it might sound like a complicated term, but a balance sheet is, I think, something that most people are fairly familiar with when they talk about home equity. So, if I were to draw a balance sheet for someone's house, it would look something like this.
Sal:
So the asset would be your house, whatever it's worth, and then your liability, and I'll call that A for asset, and then your liability would be your mortgage. Your liability would be the loan. Rick:
Now, if your house is worth $1 million, and your loan, let's say you owe 800,000 on your loan. Rick:
Sal: Whatever's left over is your equity.
Rick: Right.
Sal: That's a balance sheet.
That's a balance sheet that I think most people are fairly familiar with. For corporations, they have the exact same notion. And I think this is an important point to realize when people talk about the stock market and what does it mean for a company's stock to go to 0?
Sal: ... what's left over is essentially the equity.
When you buy a stock in a bank or any company, you're essentially taking a share of that. So what's broken here is through the housing bubble, a lot of these banks, in order to facilitate this whole securitization, and I can go into more detail into what that is, they essentially accumulated these assets on their balance sheets. This has been, this has been the central focus of the entire bailout plan, and there's been a lot of talk about toxic CDOs and what are they worth, but I just want to show you what they do to a bank's balance sheet, and why it's so important that we figure out what these things are worth because you see here,
Compute 23 times 44. And maybe the hardest part of this problem, or maybe the first hard part, is to recognize that that dot even means multiplication. This could have also been written as 23 times 44, or they could have written it as 23 in parentheses times 44, so you just put the two parentheses next to each other.
Let's say we we've been hanging out in scenario E for a bunch of days. On average we've been catching one rabbit, but gathering 280 berries. We were, I guess, in a berry mood, so this is scenario E right over here.
I have to stay on the production possibilities frontier, sometimes abbreviated as PPF or I guess the acronym for it, I should say, is PPF.
But if I want one more rabbit, the production possibilities frontier drops off and I will have to give up forty fruits. So one more rabbit means that I have a cost. So I have to give up, on average, forty berries and the technical term for what I have just described is the opportunity cost of going after one more rabbit is giving up forty berries.
A common house spider has 8 eyes. If a spider is looking at you with its 2 front eyes and 3 of its other eyes, what fraction of its eyes are looking at you? And just to show that we're not making this stuff up, these are actual pictures of spiders and you see in each of these pictures that they have 8 eyes.
A strong cipher is one which disguises your fingerprint. To make a lighter fingerprint is to flatten this distribution of letter frequencies.
By the mid 15th century, we had advanced the polyalphabetic ciphers to accomplish this. Imagine Alice and Bob shared a secret shift word. First, Alice converts the word into numbers according of the letter position in the alphabet.
Bob decrypts the message by subtracting the shifts according to the secret word he also has a copy of.
Now imagine a codebreaker, Eve, intercepts a series of messages and calculates the letter frequencies, she'll find a flatter distribution or a lighter fingerprint, so how could she break this? Remember, codebreakers look for information leaked, the same as finding a partial fingerprint. Any time there's a differential in letter frequencies, a leak of information occurs.
There's a very popular and I thought, good movie, out based on the play, which is based on the novel by Victor Hugo, Les Miserables and I'm sure I'm mispronouncing it. It means The Miserable, for who it was not obvious.
But let's fast forward. There's many videos on the Khan Academy dealing with the Napoleonic wars and the French Revolution but let's fast forward to 1815. So let me do that in white again.

What I want to do in this video is make sure we really understand what is going on when we call our recursive fibonacci functions So I'm going to assume that someone calls it with an argument of and they give pass 5 as an argument I don't want to pick too large of a number cuz otherwise I'll be explaining it forever
Where we left off after the meiosis videos is that we had two gametes. We had a sperm and an egg. Let me draw the sperm.
And actually, it comes from the word for mulberry because it looks like a mulberry. So actually, let me just kind of simplify things a little bit because we don't have to start here. So we start with a zygote.
Now, once the morula gets to about 16 cells or so-- and we're talking about four or five days. This isn't an exact process-- they started differentiating a little bit, where the outer cells-- and this kind of turns into a sphere.
Let me scroll over. I don't want to go there. And then the inner cells, and this is kind of the crux of what this video is all about-- let me scroll down a little bit.
And then what's going to happen is some fluid's going to start filling in some of this gap between the embryoblast and the trophoblast, so you're going to start having some fluid that comes in there, and so the morula will eventually look like this, where the trophoblast, or the outer membrane, is kind of this huge sphere of cells. And this is all happening as they keep replicating.
Mitosis is the mechanism, so now my trophoblast is going to look like that, and then my embryoblast is going to look like this.
Sometimes the embryoblast-- so this is the embryoblast. Sometimes it's also called the inner cell mass, so let me write that.
And this is what's going to turn into the organism. And so, just so you know a couple of the labels that are involved here, if we're dealing with a mammalian organism, and we are mammals, we call this thing that the morula turned into is a zygote, then a morula, then the cells of the morula started to differentiate into the trophoblast, or kind of the outside cells, and then the embryoblast.
And then you have this space that forms here, and this is just fluid, and it's called the blastocoel.
A very non-intuitive spelling of the coel part of blastocoel. But once this is formed, this is called a blastocyst. That's the entire thing right here.
Now, it can be a very confusing topic, because a lot of times in a lot of books on biology, you'll say, hey, you go from the morula to the blastula or the blastosphere stage. Let me write those words down. So sometimes you'll say morula, and you go to blastula.
Sometimes it's called the blastosphere.
And I want to make it very clear that these are essentially the same stages in development. These are just for-- you know, in a lot of books, they'll start talking about frogs or tadpoles or things like that, and this applies to them.
While we're talking about mammals, especially the ones that are closely related to us, the stage is the blastocyst stage, and the real differentiator is when people talk about just blastula and blastospheres.
There isn't necessarily this differentiation between these outermost cells and these embryonic, or this embryoblast, or this inner cell mass here. But since the focus of this video is humans, and really that's where I wanted to start from, because that's what we are and that's what's interesting, we're going to focus on the blastocyst. Now, everything I've talked about in this video, it was really to get to this point, because what we have here, these little green cells that I drew right here in the blastocysts, this inner cell mass, this is what will turn into the organism.
As soon as it starts dividing, each of these cells are called a blastomere. And you're probably wondering, Sal, why does this word blast keep appearing in this kind of embryology video, these development videos? And that comes from the Greek for spore: blastos.
So when I talk what embryonic stem cells, I'm talking about the individual blastomeres inside of this embryoblast or inside of this inner cell mass. These words are actually unusually fun to say. So each of these is an embryonic stem cell.
We're dealing with multiple sclerosis or who knows what. The idea is, look, we have these cell here that could turn into anything, and we're just really understanding how it knows what to turn into. It really has to look at its environment and say, hey, what are the guys around me doing, and maybe that's what helps dictate what it does.
And that's because in all of our bodies, you do have what are called somatic stem cells. Let me write that down.
Somatic or adults stem cells. And we all have them.
They're in our bone marrow to help produce red blood cells, other parts of our body, but the problem with somatic stem cells is they're not as plastic, which means that they can't form any type of cell in the human body. There's an area of research where people are actually maybe trying to make them more plastic, and if they are able to take these somatic stem cells and make them more plastic, it might maybe kill the need to have these embryonic stem cells, although maybe if they do this too good, maybe these will have the potential to turn into human beings as well, so that could become a debatable issue.
But right now, this isn't an area of debate because, left to their own devices, a somatic stem cell or an adult stem cell won't turn into a human being, while an embryonic one, if it is implanted in a willing mother, then, of course, it will turn into a human being. And I want to make one side note here, because I don't want to take any sides on the debate of-- well, I mean, facts are facts. This does have the potential to turn into a human being, but it also has the potential to save millions of lives.
So these all become zygotes, and then they allow them to develop, and they usually allow them to develop to the blastocyst stage. So eventually all of these turn into blastocysts. They have a blastocoel in the center, which is this area of fluid.
They produce these gametes. The male gamete fertilizes a female gamete. The zygote happens or gets created and starts splitting up the morula, and then it keeps splitting and it differentiates into the blastocyst, and then this is where the stem cells are.
So you already know enough science to engage in kind of a very heated debate.
We're asked:
Do the points on the graph below represent a function? So in order for the points to represent a function, for every input into our function, we can only get one value. So if we look here, they've graphed the point--it looks
This is the point 2, negative 2, so that still seems consistent with being a function. If you pass me 2, I will map you or I will point you to negative 2. Seems fair enough.
This is a sample SRT.
So, in this problem, they're telling us in outer space, the distance an object travels varies directly with the amount of time that it travels. And, that's of course assuming that it's not accelerating, and there's no net force, and all of that on it. So, I guess they're talking about a specific object.
My name is Emiliano Salinas and I'm going to talk about the role we members of society play in the violent atmosphere this country is living in right now. I was born in 1976. I grew up in a traditional Mexican family.
"If you want your ransom come and get it.
We'll be waiting for you right here." They stayed there. Seven days later, Eric was set free and was able to return home.
"Be the change you wish to see in the world." Today in Mexico we're asking for Gandhis. We need Gandhis.
Multiply 1 and 3/4 times 7 and 1/5. Simplify your answer and write it as a mixed fraction. So the first thing we want to do is rewrite each of these mixed numbers as improper fractions.
Four years ago today, exactly, actually,
I started a fashion blog called Style Rookie. Last September of 2011, I started an online magazine for teenage girls called Rookiemag.com. My name's Tavi Gevinson, and the title of my talk is "Still Figuring It Out," and the MS Paint quality of my slides was a total creative decision in keeping with today's theme, and has nothing to do with my inability to use PowerPoint.
(Laughter) So I edit this site for teenage girls. I'm a feminist.
I don't like to acknowledge a problem without also acknowledging those who work to fix it, so just wanted to acknowledge shows like "Mad Men," movies like "Bridesmaids," whose female characters or protagonists are complex, multifaceted. Lena Dunham, who's on here, her show on HBO that premiers next month, "Girls," she said she wanted to start it because she felt that every woman she knew was just a bundle of contradictions, and that feels accurate for all people, but you don't see women represented like that as much. Congrats, guys.
But I don't feel that — I still feel that there are some types of women who are not represented that way, and one group that we'll focus on today are teens, because I think teenagers are especially contradictory and still figuring it out, and in the '90s there was "Freaks and Geeks" and "My So-Called Life," and their characters,
Lindsay Weir and Angela Chase, I mean, the whole premise of the shows were just them trying to figure themselves out, basically, but those shows only lasted a season each, and I haven't really seen anything like that on TV since. So this is a scientific diagram of my brain — (Laughter) — around the time when I was, when I started watching those TV shows.
So I'm not saying, "Be like us," and "We're perfect role models," because we're not, but we just want to help represent girls in a way that shows those different dimensions. I mean, we have articles called
How to Not Care What People Think of You," but we also have articles like, oops -- I'm figuring it out!
"How to Look Like You Weren't Just Crying in Less than Five Minutes." So all of that being said, I still really appreciate those characters in movies and articles like that on our site, that aren't just about being totally powerful, maybe finding your acceptance with yourself and self-esteem and your flaws and how you accept those. So what I you to take away from my talk, the lesson of all of this, is to just be Stevie Nicks.
Because my favorite thing about her, other than, like, everything, is that she is very -- has always been unapologetically present on stage, and unapologetic about her flaws and about reconciling all of her contradictory feelings and she makes you listen to them and think about them, and yeah, so please be Stevie Nicks. Thank you. (Applause)
Male 1: In the last few videos we looked at the final version, the Declaration of Independence as it was approved of. Here it seems like we have a very not final version of the Declaration.
Then he shows it to Adams and he shows it to Franklin, very deferential, he said, "With your broadened view of the world, Dr. Franklin, perhaps you can make some suggestions." Male 1: Franklin and Adams could be his father.

We're going to talk about bronze casting and maybe begin a little bit with the history of the medium and what we're looking at is a recovered ancient Greek bronze sculpture that looks like it's been through some hard times, but it's important to remember that that's how ancient Greek sculpture looked.
Dr. Drogin: That's right. A lot of the classical figures that were created by the ancient Greeks, like this one from around the 3rd century BCE, were made out of bronze.
Dr. Harris: Also, the bronze was often melted down during the middle ages, because first of all, these are just pagan sculptures that Christians didn't care about in the middle ages, but also bronze was and still is a valuable metal.
Dr. Drogin: It's very, very valuable metal. Mostly made out of copper and tin and it's expensive, just in terms of a raw material, that's right.
Excuse me, when bronze sculpture was destroyed that was often why it was. Dr. Harris: Let's look at another example of a bronze sculpture from the Renaissance.
Dr. Drogin:
What we can see here is an incredibly highly finished, very smooth, and even gilded small bronze sculpture.
Dr. Harris: How small is this?
Dr. Drogin:
Dr. Harris:
Oh, it is small.
Dr. Drogin: It's pretty small. What's really exceptional about his work, and this is a good example to talk about bronze with, is that it does have this very, very smooth finish and a lot of detail and then, of course, some very nice gilding, as well.
Dr. Harris: The ability to cast bronze, and we'll talk about that in a second, had been lost during the middle ages and it's rediscovered in the Renaissance.
Dr. Drogin:
That's right.
Bronze, aside from things like church bells and, later on, artillery, is not something that people in the middle ages were very interested in. So the process of casting bronze for art, for sculpture wasn't something that was done very much, especially in a large scale.
It is something that, in the Renaissance, they start making foundries again to create this kind of work. Let's talk about process a little bit, because when we're looking at the finished product, it might be very spectacular to the eye, but in fact, it doesn't reveal very much of how it was made and in fact, the making of the object is purposefully hidden behind the pristine finish that we see a lot, especially in Renaissance sculpture. Let's look at a diagram that explains the process that was current.
Dr. Harris:
This process is called?
Dr. Drogin: This is the lost wax process, which is a process that the ancients used and then is used again in the Renaissance.
Dr. Harris:
And still used today.
Dr. Drogin:
Dr. Harris: Really you're kind of carving first out of wax. That's right, but technically speaking, you're not even carving.
Dr. Harris: The clay would have to harden.
Dr. Drogin: That's right, you do want the clay to harden. The next step is you're actually going to heat up the whole thing.
Dr. Harris: So we're losing the wax.
The wax is gone and now you can see why we have those pins there, because when the wax disappears, if there weren't these pins holding everything in place, the clay core in the middle would drop down and it wouldn't give you the space where your bronze is going to go.
Dr. Harris: So you're kind of creating a mold.
Dr. Drogin: That's exactly what you're doing. The next step is, as you can see in this side of the diagram in B, you want to pour your molten bronze into the mold and the bronze is going to go everywhere that the wax was.
Dr. Harris: So you're pouring really hot bronze.
Hundreds and hundreds of degrees fahrenheit and it's molten.
Dr. Harris:
Dangerous.
Dr. Drogin: Very dangerous. It's very hot and you pour it in and then, once you filled it up and you think that the bronze has gone everywhere you need it to go, you let it cool off.
Dr. Harris: Imperfections.
Dr. Drogin: A lot of imperfections, plus you also have all of these pins that are still sticking out of it. So the next process, which is incredibly time consuming and oftentimes the most time consuming part of making a bronze sculpture, is finishing or chasing the bronze.
So would you reheat the bronze to make these?
Dr. Drogin: You can do that. Like the ones we see on the helmet here of Goliath from Donatello's David and Goliath?
This is the head of Goliath from Donatello's sculpture of the mid-15th century and you can see things like the texture in here and between these vegetal designs or the texture here, this kind of hammering that give you these circular texture marks even here,
Dr. Harris:
Just by hammering.
Dr. Drogin: Just by hammering. Then -
Dr. Harris:
Maybe using a stencil and hammering.
Dr. Drogin:
literally, 100 times more. But of course it's much more durable medium (crosstalk) and even more durable than stone.
It's more durable than wood, of course, and it is more durable than marble.
Bronze, instead has incredibly good tensile strength and so you can achieve things in bronze that you would never be able to achieve in marble. Dr. Harris:
Let's say a patient comes in the clinic and they're trying to decide if they want to get the flu vaccine.
For patients who are particularly concerned about this, if available you can offer them the nasal spray, Flumist.
This provides the same protection against flu without using needles. Let's counter these common risks with the common benefits of the flu vaccine. The most obvious of which of course is you have a decreased chance of getting sick with the flu.
Guillain-Barre Syndrome is a nerve problem that leads to muscle weakness and although there was never any proof that the flu vaccine actually caused Guillain-Barre, since 1976 we've been screening for this condition to make sure that it doesn't lead to severe complications.
That is a decreased chance of hospitalizations and a decreased chance of death as a result of complications of the flu virus.
So if you remember from before, flu can cause up to 200,000 hospitalizations every year, and anywhere from 20 to 40,000 deaths every year. So again, if I was a patient trying to make this decision based on these more rare benefits and risks,
I would go with the flu shot in this case as well. Because I would much rather avoid hospitalization and death if at all possible. So these are some considerations to think about on an individual level.
What happens to this patient's family members or their coworkers, or classmates if your patient is a healthcare worker. How does the flu vaccine affect their patients? Well, there is no risk involved in getting a flu vaccine when you think about it from the perspective of a family member.
John: Hi, I'm John Green. This is Crash Course World History and today things are going to get a little bit confusing, because we're going to talk about revolution and independence in Latin America.
To get a sense of how patriarchy shaped Latin American lives, take a gander at Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz, who's name I'm actually abbreviating. A child prodigy who spoke five languages by the age of 16, de la Cruz wanted to disguise herself as a boy so she could attend university, but she was forbidden to do so. Still, she wrote plays and poetry, she studied math and natural science, and for being one of the leading minds of the 17th century, she was widely attacked and eventually forced to abandon her work and sell all 4,000 of her books.
That's a shame, because she had a great mind, once writing that Aristotle would've written more if he'd done any cooking. A couple other things. First, Latin America led the world in transculturation or cultural blending.
A new and distinct Latin American culture emerged, mixing one, whites from Spain, called Peninsulares, two, whites born in the Americas, called Creoles, three, Native Americans, and four, African slaves. This blending of cultures may be most obvious when looking at Native American and African influences on Christianity. The Virgin of Guadalupe, for instance, was still called Tonatzine, the indigenous earth goddess, by the Indians and the profusion of blood in Mexican iconography recalls the Aztec use of blood in ritual.
Transculturation pervaded Latin American life from food to secular music to fashion. Somewhat related, Latin America had a great deal of racial diversity and a rigid social hierarchy to match. There were four basic racial categories:
What I wanna do in this video is think about the origins of Algebra, the origins of Algebra. And the word especially an association with the ideas that Algebra now represents. comes from, comes from, this book or actually this is a page of the book right over there. The English translation for the title of this book is,
"The Compendious book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing." And it was written by a Persian mathematician who lived in Baghdad, in, in... I believe it was in the 8th or 9th century
A.D. And Algebra is the Arabic word that here is the actual title that he gave to it which is the Arabic title "Algebra means restoration or completion" restoration... restoration or completion... completion
I know just enough Urdu or Hindi to understand a good Indian movie. But Al Kitab 'Kitab' means "book". So this part is 'book'.
Al-Muhktasar I think that means 'compendious' because I don't know the word for compendious and that seems like that.
Fi Hisab, 'Hisab' means 'calculation' in Hindi or Urdu so this is calculation.
Al-Gabr this is the root. This is the famous Algebra. This is where it shows up.
And then if we fast forward to about 200-300 A.D., so right over there, you have a Greek gentleman who lived in Alexanderia. So this is Greece right over here, but he lived in Alexandria which at the time was part of the Roman Empire.
So Alexandria is right over here. And he was a gentleman by the name of
Diophantus or Diaphantus or I don't know how to pronounce it. Dio... Diophantus. and he is sometimes credited with being the father of Algebra.
Al-Khwārizmī' who kinda started using these these terms of balancing equations and talking about math in a pure way while Diophantus was more focused on particular problems. And both of them were kind of beat to the punch by the Babylonians although they all did contribute in their own way. It's not like they were just copying what the Babylonians did.
And then of course you have Al-Khwārizmī' who shows up right about there.
Al-Khwārizmī' and he's the gentleman that definitely we credit with the name Algebra, comes from Arabic for 'Restoration' and some people also consider him to be, if not the father of Algebra, although some say he is the father, he is one of the fathers of Algebra, because he really started to think about Algebra in the abstract sense, devoid of some specific problems, and a lot of the ways that a modern mathematician would start to think about the field.
 Let's do some equations of lines in point-slope form. And this is different from y or from slope-intercept form.
In point-slope form, it takes the form y minus y1-- and I'll tell you what y1 is in a second-- is equal to m times x minus x1, where the coordinate x1, y1 is a point on the line. That's why this is called point-slope form. Now, these are just two different ways of writing the exact same thing.
 A contractor is purchasing some stone tiles for a new patio. Each tile costs $3, and he wants to spend less than $1,000.
So let x be equal to the number of tiles purchased. And so the cost of purchasing x tiles, they're going to be $3 each, so it's going to be 3x. So 3x is going to be the total cost of purchasing the tiles.
If it was less than or equal to, we'd have a little equal sign right there. So if we want to solve for x, how many tiles can he buy? We can divide both sides of this inequality by 3.
So if he can buy less than 333 and 1/3 tiles, then the patio also has to be less than 333 and 1/3 square feet.
Feet squared, we could say square feet.
So we're asked to add 3/15 plus 7/15, and then simplify the answer. So just the process when you add fractions is if they already-- well, first of all, if they're not mixed numbers, and neither of these are, and if they have the same denominator. In this example, the denominators are already the same.
that is a second section, and then a third section, fourth section, and then we have a fifth section. Let me copy and paste this whole thing. So that's five sections right there.
Let's write 0.8 as a fraction.
So 0.8... the 8 right over here is in the tenths place. So you can read this as 8 tenths and we can write that literally as being equal to 8 tenths or 8 over 10.
We're asked to identify the numerator and denominator in the fraction three over four, or three-fourths. Let's rewrite this, so it's nice and big. So let me just write the fraction.
Host; When I was growing up, I had a mentor who wasn't much older than me. And he just walked in, Jason Daniels, and he was always pushing me, even at a young age, to be great, trying to pull the best out of me. So, whenever I talk to young people now, no matter how old they are, no matter how young they are,
I'm a technology entrepreneur, so when I saw young Jonathan Buchanan, and I read his story
- he's ten years old, he's an app developer - he's the youngest person in the world to have an iPhone app in the Apple App Store that he developed all by himself. And he's from here. Ladies and gentlemen, Jonathan Buchanan.
Jonathan Buchanan:
So, I'm Jonathan. and my talk is "Learning to code, coding to learn". I'm going to start off by giving you a background about me: I coded my own iOS app completely on my own, and completely in Objective-C when I was ten years old.
I formed my first company and I submitted my first app to the App store in the same year. I'm now working on two new apps, and one big idea project. I'm passionate about coding and development.
I've learned HTML, CSS, php, Javascript, MySQL, Ruby on Rails, Objective-C, Unix and a bunch of other web-server things. (Laughter)
So I want to talk today about money and happiness, which are two things that a lot of us spend a lot of our time thinking about, either trying to earn them or trying to increase them. And a lot of us resonate with this phrase. So we see it in religions and self-help books, that money can't buy happiness.
On one Vancouver morning, we went out on the campus at University of British Columbia and we approached people and said, "Do you want to be in an experiment?" They said, "Yes." We asked them how happy they were, and then we gave them an envelope.
"By 5:00 pm today, spend this money on yourself." So we gave some examples of what you could spend it on. Other people, in the morning, got a slip of paper that said,
"What'd you spend it on, and how happy do you feel now?" What did they spend it on? Well these are college undergrads, so a lot of what they spent it on for themselves were things like earrings and makeup.
So we went, in fact, to Uganda and ran a very similar experiment.
So imagine, instead of just people in Canada, we said, "Name the last time you spent money on yourself or other people.
Describe it. How happy did it make you?" Or in Uganda, "Name the last time you spent money on yourself or other people and describe that."
So for example, one guy from Uganda says this. He said, "I called a girl I wished to love." They basically went out on a date, and he says at the end that he didn't "achieve" her up till now.
"I took my girlfriend out for dinner. We went to a movie, we left early, and then went back to her room for ... " only cake -- just a piece of cake. Human universal -- so you spend money on other people, you're being nice to them.
We say, "Name a time you spent money on somebody else." She says, "I bought a present for my mom. I drove to the mall in my car, bought a present, gave it to my mom."
"I was walking and met a long-time friend whose son was sick with malaria. They had no money, they went to a clinic and I gave her this money." This isn't $10,000, it's the local currency.
We got data from the Gallup Organization, which you know from all the political polls that have been happening lately.
They ask people, "Did you donate money to charity recently?" and they ask them, "How happy are you with your life in general?" And we can see what the relationship is between those two things. Are they positively correlated?
Some teams, we give people on the team some money for themselves and say, "Spend it however you want on yourself," just like we did with the undergrads in Canada. But other teams we say, "Here's 15 euro. Spend it on one of your teammates this week.
DonorsChoose.org is a non-profit for mainly public school teachers in low-income schools.
They post projects, so they say, "I want to teach Huckleberry Finn to my class and we don't have the books," or "I want a microscope to teach my students science and we don't have a microscope."
You and I can go on and buy it for them. The teacher writes you a thank you note. The kids write you a thank you note.
Go to the website and start yourself on the process of thinking, again, less about "How can I spend money on myself?" and more about "If I've got five dollars or 15 dollars, what can I do to benefit other people?" Because ultimately when you do that, you'll find that you'll benefit yourself much more. Thank you.
 Use the quadratic formula to solve the equation, 0 is equal to negative 7q squared plus 2q plus 9. Now, the quadratic formula, it applies to any quadratic equation of the form-- we could put the 0 on the left hand side.
What's the square root of 256? It's 16. You can try it out for yourself.
I've been at MlT for 44 years. I went to TED I. There's only one other person here, I think, who did that.
It's amazing when you meet a head of state, and you say, "What is your most precious natural resource?" They will not say "children" at first, and then when you say, "children," they will pretty quickly agree with you.
So with those as the principles -- some of you may know Seymour Papert. This is back in 1982, when we were working in Senegal. Because some people think that the $100 laptop just happened a year ago, or two years ago, or we were struck by lightning -- this actually has gone back a long time, and in fact, back to the '60s.
"We'd like to do three or four thousand in our country to see how it works." Go to the back of the line and someone else will do it, and then when you figure out that this works, you can join as well.
It's kind of agonizing, because a lot of people say, "Let's do it at the state level," because states are more nimble than the feds, just because of size. And yet we count. We're really dealing with the federal government.
So I'm here to tell you a story of success from Africa.
A year and a half ago, four of the five people who are full time members at Ushahidi, which means "testimony" in Swahili, were TED Fellows.
A year ago in Kenya we had post-election violence. And in that time we prototyped and built, in about three days, a system that would allow anybody with a mobile phone to send in information and reports on what was happening around them. We took what we knew about Africa, the default device, the mobile phone, as our common denominator, and went from there.
This is just a couple of them from January 17th, last year. And our system was rudimentary. It was very basic.
And so we build for it in Africa first and then we move to the edges. It's now been deployed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
It's being used by NGOs all over East Africa, small NGOs doing their own little projects. Just this last month it was deployed by Al Jazeera in Gaza.
This is the Twitter reports for over three days just covering Mumbai. How do you decide what is important? What is the veracity level of what you're looking at?
And we are very happy to be part of the TED family. (Applause)
Alan found 4 marbles to add to his 5 marbles currently in his pocket. He then had a competition with his friends and tripled his marbles. Write a numerical expression to model the situation without performing any operations.
In the United States, 13 out of every 20 cans are recycled.
And we could say,
"Hey, look, 20 goes into 13 zero (0) times."
0 х 20 is 0. (0 х 20 = 0). And then 13 - 0 = 13.
"Look, "percent" literally means "per hundred"
So, 13 out of 20 is going to be equal to what over - is going to be equal to what over 100? Well, to go from 20 to a 100 - (Forget the denominator.) To go from 20 to 100, you would multiply by 5.
So, we've been going through all of the others things that we were assuming are held constant in order to be moving along one demand curve. And now let's list a few other[s].
And before I do any more of them, let's talk about the ones we already talked about.
So - one- we said that one of the things we held constant - (Let me write this down.)
So - (WRlTING: held constant.) One of the things that we held constant to move along one demand curve, for the demand itself not to shift - for the curve not to shift - is price of related goods. [WRlTING]
But you'll see that in the next few videos, that there are often special cases even to this.
So, the other thing that we've been holding constant to stay on one demand curve is income. And this one is fairly intuitive. What happens if everyone's income were to increase?
And so, for any given price point, the demand would increase.
And so, it would increase the demand. And once again, when we talk about increasing demand, we're talking about shifting the entire curve. We're not talking about a particular quantity of demand.
So, income goes up, then [that] increases demand. [WRlTING] Demand goes up.
So the whole curve, this whole demand schedule would change. And likewise, if income went down, demand would go down. And [as] we're going to see in a future video, it's actually quite interesting, that's not, always ... the case.
This is only true for normal goods. [WRlTING] "normal goods." And in a future video we'll see goods called "inferior goods," where this is NOT necessarily the case.
Or, by definition, for an inferior good, it would not be the case.
Now the other ones that are somewhat intuitive are population. [WRlTING] Once again, if population goes up -- obviously -- at any given price point, more people will want it.
So, it would shift the demand curve to the right -- or it would increase demand. If population were to go down, it would decrease demand, which means shifting the whole curve to the left. And then the last one we'll talk about --
We're assuming that people's tastes and preferences don't change while we move along a specific demand curve. If preferences actually change, then it will change the curve.
So, for example, if, all of a sudden ... the author of [a] book is on some very popular show -- talk show -- that tells everyone that this is the best book that was ever written, then preferences would go up, and that would increase the total demand.
At any given price point, more people would be willing to buy the book. If, on the other hand, on that same talk show, it turns out that they do an exposé on the author having this sordid past and [they state that] the author plagiarized the whole book, then the demand will go down.
The entire curve, regardless of the price point -- at any given price point -- the quantity demanded will actually go down.
Move the orange dot to 9/4 on the number line. Let's think about this number line right here. This is 0.
just a remarkable portrait itself lifelike i love to have such a collar and the hat and the feather and couldnt she pose the way and she peeks out at something.its so animated and its so really wonderful. for all of the odephus and all the complexities in the costume not only very natural but she comes with full energy and curiosity.you feel as if you'll get a sense of fucials. oh completely. this is commisisioned by her husband here.on the eve of french revolution her name is madame perregaux and supported by elizabeth vishale the bronx. just look at the way the many is constructed. she has taken a very simple composition. very traditional of a woman and to have ones potrait, with the curtain on one side and space on the other in a balcony. but she has created first of all a sense of immanuation by creaating something barn and also some humor. absolutely. but hse is also forgoing considering that lovely orcorn at the lower right that begins to send off a couple of other arcs of her arms, of her collar of her hat and then of her lovely red ribbon the just trims her waist though. she has taken a formal element of that broken curtain that we see behind of figures and portraits that made it something much more playful. yeh really engaging and its jus a piece of example masterful to how a portrait can be brought to life
Where we left off in the last video,
Toussaint L'Ouverture had just been betrayed by, on some level, first by some of his right-hand men, because they joined the side of Leclerc or essentially they gave up rebelling against Leclerc, convinced that Leclerc wasn't that bad, that he had no intention of reinstating slavery or taking away the civil rights of the freemen of African descent.
He went to negotiate with Leclerc,
Leclerc imprisoned him, put him on a boat, and sent him to France and he died the next year in 1803. So he was betrayed. And died in prison in 1803.
He actually helped defend what is now Haiti, but Saint-Domingue against the British Royal Navy. I forgot to mention that in the... Defended against the British Navy, which at the time was the... by far the dominant navy in the world.
Leclerc really does deserve devil horns of a sort although we're about to meet someone who deserves much bigger devil horns, or maybe that he was actually the henchman for someone who deserves devil horns In May of 1802 Napoleon signs a law that says... that reinstates slavery where it has not disappeared.
They knew that they needed the help of some of Toussaint L'Ouverture's former generals, former right-hand men, in order to keep control of Haiti. But the intention the entire time was, when they have the upper hand, to actually clamp down, reinstate slavery, and take away the civil rights of the freemen of color. Now these guys weren't stupid either.
He was also a former slave, one of Toussaint L'Ouverture's right-hand men, very effective general.
And, as you remember, near the end of the fight against Leclerc, he gave up the fight against Leclerc and to some degree you could say he turned on Toussaint L'Ouverture.
But he and some of the other former followers of L'Ouverture saw the writing on the wall.
They got word from Martinique and Tobago and Saint Lucia they got word that slavery was being reinstated. The French at this time were not people that you wanted to deal with or trust when it came to issues of slavery. So Dessalines and his comrades re-took up arms.
And Dessalines was a very different character than Toussaint L'Ouverture. The one similarity is that they were both very effective military men. The big difference between the two was that
I mentioned, I gave him little devil horns-- he was replaced by someone who deserves very big devil horns named Rochambeau. Not to be confused with his father, who goes by the same name who was a hero of the American Revolution. He fought for France on the side of the Americans.
Rochambeau buried 500 rebel prisoners alive, then Dessalines went and hung 500 French prisoners. So he wasn't someone to kind of shy away from, I guess, blood.
And this is very different to Toussaint L'Ouverture. It's kind of a lesson. If you are fighting an enemy, if you get rid of the more reasonable leaders of your enemy, you might end up getting maybe a leader more similar to yourself and your cruelty, if you betrayed the more reasonable ones.
Napoleon gives up on maintaining all of their colonies or any major presence in the Western Hemisphere. So essentially to raise funds, Napoleon also sells Louisiana to the Americans.
They got all of Louisiana. Now France is telling Haiti, you owe us F90 million. Or that's roughly the equivalent of $14 or $15 billion in today's terms.
Charles Van Doren, who was later a senior editor of Britannica, said the ideal encyclopedia should be radical -- it should stop being safe. But if you know anything about the history of Britannica since 1962, it was anything but radical: still a very completely safe, stodgy type of encyclopedia. Wikipedia, on the other hand, begins with a very radical idea, and that's for all of us to imagine a world in which every single person on the planet is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge.
It's written using wiki software -- which is the type of software he just demonstrated -- so anyone can quickly edit and save, and it goes live on the Internet immediately. And everything about Wikipedia is managed by virtually an all-volunteer staff. So when Yochai is talking about new methods of organization, he's exactly describing Wikipedia.
So Yochai showed you the graph of what the cost of a printing press was. And I'm going to tell you what the cost of Wikipedia is. But first, I'll show you how big it is.
We hired Brian because he was working part-time for two years and full-time at Wikipedia, so we actually hired him, so he could get a life and go to the movies sometimes. So the big question when you've got this really chaotic organization is, why isn't it all rubbish? Why is the website as good as it is?
So a German magazine compared German Wikipedia, which is much, much smaller than English, to Microsoft Encarta and to Brockhaus multimedial, and we won across the board. They hired experts to come and look at articles and compare the quality, and we were very pleased with that result. So a lot of people have heard about the Wikipedia Bush-Kerry controversy.
It started out with an article in Red Herring. The reporters called me up and they -- I mean, I have to say they spelled my name right, but they really wanted to say the Bush-Kerry election is so contentious, it's tearing apart the Wikipedia community.
"Extreme action sometimes has to be taken, and Wales locked the entries on Kerry and Bush for most of 2004." This came after I told the reporter that we had to lock it for -- occasionally a little bit here and there. So the truth in general is that the kinds of controversies that you would probably think we have within the Wikipedia community are not really controversies at all.
The actual truth about the specific Bush-Kerry incident is that the Bush-Kerry articles were locked less than one percent of the time in 2004, and it wasn't because they were contentious; it was just because there was routine vandalism -- which happens sometimes even on stage ... (Laughter)
Sometimes even reporters have reported to me that they vandalized Wikipedia and were amazed that it was fixed so quickly. And I said -- you know, I always say, please don't do that. That's not a good thing.
That recent changes page was also fed into an IRC channel, which is an Internet chat channel that people are monitoring with various software tools. And people can get RSS feeds -- they can get email notifications of changes. And then users can set up their own personal watch list.
This is really important because a lot of new pages are just garbage that has to be deleted, you know, "ASDFASDF." But also, that's some of the most interesting and fun things, some of the new articles. People will start an article on some interesting topic, other people will find that intriguing and jump in and help and make it much better.
What's nice about this page is you can immediately take a look at this and see, "OK, I understand now." When somebody goes and looks at -- they see that someone, an anonymous IP number, made an edit to my page.
That sounds suspicious. Who is this person? Somebody looks at it -- they can immediately see highlighted in red all of the changes that took place -- to see, OK, well, these words have changed, things like this.
And so the method that arose organically within the community is the Votes For Deletion page. And in the particular example we have here, it's a film, "Twisted Issues," and the first person says, "Now this is supposedly a film.
The Google test is you look in Google and see if it's there, because if something's not even in Google, it probably doesn't exist at all. It's not a perfect rule, but it's a nice starting point for quick research. So somebody says, "Delete it, please.
I found it in a book, 'Film Threat Video Guide: the 20 Underground Films You Must See.'" So the next persons says, "Clean it up."
"OK, 18 deletes, two keeps: we'll delete it." But in other cases, this could be 18 deletes and two keeps, and we would keep it, because if those last two keeps say, "Wait a minute.
Down here at the bottom, "Keep, real movie," RickK. RickK is a very famous Wikipedian who does an enormous amount of work with vandalism, hoaxes and votes for deletion. His voice carries a lot of weight within the community because he knows what he's doing.
There's a certain amount of aristocracy. You got a hint of that when I mentioned, like, RickK's voice would carry a lot more weight than someone we don't know.
I give this talk sometimes with Angela, who was just re-elected to the board from the community -- to the Board of the Foundation, with more than twice the votes of the person who didn't make it. And I always embarrass her because I say, "Well, Angela, for example, could get away with doing absolutely anything within Wikipedia, because she's so admired and so powerful."
I was describing this in Berlin once, and the next day in the newspaper the headline said, "I am the Queen of England." (Laughter)
Within the free software world, there's been a long-standing tradition of the "benevolent dictator" model.
So if you look at most of the major free software projects, they have one single person in charge who everyone agrees is the benevolent dictator. Well, I don't like the term "benevolent dictator," and I don't think that it's my job or my role in the world of ideas to be the dictator of the future of all human knowledge compiled by the world. It just isn't appropriate.
Yeah, hi, Ben Saunders.
Jimmy, you mentioned impartiality being a key to Wikipedia's success. It strikes me that much of the textbooks that are used to educate our children are inherently biased. Have you found Wikipedia being used by teachers and how do you see Wikipedia changing education?
Yeah, so, a lot of teachers are beginning to use Wikipedia. There's a media storyline about Wikipedia, which I think is false. It builds on the storyline of bloggers versus newspapers.
The last time I got an email from a journalist saying, "Why do academics hate Wikipedia?" I sent it from my Harvard email address because I was recently appointed a fellow there.
And I said, "Well, they don't all hate it." (Laughter) But I think there's going to be huge impacts.
I love theater. I love the idea that you can transform, become somebody else and look at life with a completely new perspective. I love the idea that people will sit in one room for a couple of hours and listen.
I was commissioned in 2003 to create an original show, and began developing "Upwake."
"Upwake" tells the story of Zero, a modern-day business man, going to work with his life in a suitcase, stuck between dream and reality and not able to decipher the two.
I wanted "Upwake" to have the same audiovisual qualities as a movie would. And I wanted to let my imagination run wild. So I began drawing the story that was moving in my head.
If Antoine de Saint-Exupery, the author of "The Little Prince," were here, he would have drawn three holes inside that box and told you your sheep was inside. Because, if you look closely enough, things will begin to appear. This is not a box; these are the renderings of my imagination from head to paper to screen to life.
In "Upwake" buildings wear suits, Zero tap dances on a giant keyboard, clones himself with a scanner, tames and whips the computer mice, sails away into dreamscape from a single piece of paper and launches into space. I wanted to create environments that moved and morphed like an illusionist. Go from one world to another in a second.
(Buzzing) (Click, click, bang)
(Laughter)
(Applause) Thank you.
"Upwake" lasts 52 minutes and 54 seconds. I project 3D animation on all the four surfaces of the stage which I interact with. The use of animation and projection was a process of discovery.
There are no special effects in "Upwake," no artifice. It's as lavish and intricate as it is simple and minimal. Three hundred and forty-four frames, four and a half years and commissions later, what started as a one person show became a collaborative work of nineteen most talented artists.
(Applause) Thank you. So this is, relatively, a new show that we're now beginning to tour.
Zero became a person and not just a character in a play.
Zero does not speak, is neither man nor woman.
Zero is Zero, a little hero of the 21st Century, and Zero can touch so many more people than I possibly could.
It's as much about bringing new disciplines inside this box as it is about taking theater out of its box. As a street performer, I have learned that everybody wants to connect. And that usually, if you're a bit extraordinary, if you're not exactly of human appearance, then people will feel inclined to participate and to feel out loud.
Zero wants to engage the generation of today and tomorrow, tell various stories through different mediums. Comic books. Quantum physics video games.
And Zero wants to go to the moon. In 2007, Zero launched a green campaign, suggesting his friends and fans to turn off their electricity every Sunday from 7:53 to 8:00 p.m. The idea is simple, basic.
There is a revolution. It's a human and technological revolution. It's motion and emotion.
Charlie Chaplin innovated motion pictures and told stories through music, silence, humor and poetry. He was social, and his character, The Tramp, spoke to millions. He gave entertainment, pleasure and relief to so many human beings when they needed it the most.
Find the value of 5 to the third power. Let me rewrite that. We have 5 to the third power.
571,230,000 pounds of paper towels are used by Americans every year. If we could -- correction, wrong figure. 13 billion used every year.
Your word is 'fold.' (Audience) Fold. JS:
OK. (Laughter) Wet hands. Shake.
Dry.
(Applause) (Audience) Shake.
(Audience) Fold. Cuts itself. Fold.
(Audience) Shake. (Audience) Fold. Cuts itself.
The funny thing is I get my hands drier than people do with three or four because they can't get in between the cracks. If you think this isn't as good. (Audience) Shake.
Now, there's now a real fancy invention. It's the one where you wave your hand and it kicks it out. It's was too big a towel.
Now let's all say it together. (Audience) &amp; JS: Shake.
What is BD? So, when they're just saying BD, they're saying literally the length of segment BD. So they're saying the length from point B to point D.
What is BD, again? Well, here we're going from one to four. The distance between one and four is three.
What is AD? So, A is at negative five, D is all the way at four. So, we're going from negative five to zero, which is five, and then we're gonna go four more.
About a year ago, I asked myself a question:
"Knowing what I know, why am I not a vegetarian?" After all, I'm one of the green guys: I grew up with hippie parents in a log cabin.
I started a site called TreeHugger -- I care about this stuff. I knew that eating a mere hamburger a day can increase my risk of dying by a third.
Solve the equation, 5 over x minus 1 is equal to 3 over x plus 3. And they give us two constraints here. x can't be negative 3 or 1. And that's because if x was negative 3, this expression right here, you'd be dividing by 0, it'd be undefined.
We have this system of equations here. 3t plus 4g is equal to 6. And we have negative 6t plus g is also equal to 6.
3 times negative 2/3, that's negative 2. The 3's cancel out. Plus 4 times 2 is 8.
I thought I would make a quick video to clarify some points on evolution and maybe clear up some points of ambiguity in some of my previous videos. So when you go to the natural history museum and you see these drawings where they start with a primitive ape and they show progressive species that show some form of progress, at least some form of progress when it comes to walking on two feet, it culminates with Homo Sapiens-- us-- you imagine that evolution is kind of this process that creates better and better things. You imagine that there's this notion of progress that, as time goes on, each successive species is better than its first.
There's an infinite variation in the human eye, so it would even have to be intelligent designs, not intelligent design. But my whole point behind the video was to say if you are inclined to believe in a designer, then the more elegant design is at the system level, which really is evolution. Now, I wasn't trying to say there is a designer or there isn't a designer.
So, if you're in the audience today, or maybe you're watching this talk in some other time or place, you are a participant in the digital rights ecosystem. Whether you're an artist, a technologist, a lawyer or a fan, the handling of copyright directly impacts your life. Rights management is no longer simply a question of ownership, it's a complex web of relationships and a critical part of our cultural landscape.
YouTube cares deeply about the rights of content owners, but in order to give them choices about what they can do with copies, mashups and more, we need to first identify when copyrighted material is uploaded to our site. Let's look at a specific video so you can see how it works.
Two years ago, recording artist Chris Brown released the official video of his single "Forever." A fan saw it on TV, recorded it with her camera phone, and uploaded it to YouTube.
Because Sony Music had registered Chris Brown's video in our Content ID system, within seconds of attempting to upload the video, the copy was detected, giving Sony the choice of what to do next.
But how do we know that the user's video was a copy? Well, it starts with content owners delivering assets into our database, along with a usage policy that tells us what to do when we find a match. We compare each upload against all of the reference files in our database.
Remember Chris Brown's video "Forever"? Well, it had its day in the sun and then it dropped off the charts, and that looked like the end of the story, but sometime last year, a young couple got married. This is their wedding video.
And instead of Sony blocking, they allowed the upload to occur. And they put advertising against it and linked from it to iTunes. And the song, 18 months old, went back to number four on the iTunes charts.
And Jill and Kevin, the happy couple, they came back from their honeymoon and found that their video had gone crazy viral. And they've ended up on a bunch of talk shows, and they've used it as an opportunity to make a difference. The video's inspired over 26,000 dollars in donations to end domestic violence.
The "JK Wedding [Entrance]
Dance" became so popular that NBC parodied it on the season finale of "The Office," which just goes to show, it's truly an ecosystem of culture. Because it's not just amateurs borrowing from big studios, but sometimes big studios borrowing back. By empowering choice, we can create a culture of opportunity.
YouTube's Content ID system addresses all of these cases. But the system only works through the participation of rights owners.
If you have content that others are uploading to YouTube, you should register in the Content ID system, and then you'll have the choice about how your content is used. And think carefully about the policies that you attach to that content. By simply blocking all reuse, you'll miss out on new art forms, new audiences, new distribution channels and new revenue streams.
 We are asked to represent the following function on the coordinate plane. And they give us domain, and then they give us a range, a set of values that our function can take on.
F of negative 2 is 1. And then finally, f of 0 is 0. So we'll just plot it right there.
I'm assuming this is what they want us to do.
There are approximately three billion people living in our world today who survive on less than two U.S. dollars a day.
A zoo has 15 Emperor Penguins who make up 30% of the total number of penguins at the zoo. How many penguins live at the zoo? So let's let x equal the total number of penguins who live at the zoo.
So, they're telling us that 30% of that [number] are the emperor penguins - which is 15. So they're saying, if we take 30% -
So 30% of x is equal to 15. Or another way of saying this is we could say - instead of writing 30%, we could write that as a decimal - as 0.30 of x.
So it's 0.30 times x = 15. And now, to solve this, we just have to divide both sides by 0.30. Let's do that.
[WRlTES '0.30' TWlCE.]
We get x is equal to 15/0.30. Now that's - Let's do a little -
You could say the fraction of Emperor penguins over the total number of penguins at the zoo - So you could say - You could say 15 -
This means, "I'm smiling." So does that. This means "mouse."
"Cat." Here we have a story. The start of the story, where this means guy, and that is a ponytail on a passer-by.
"Honestly, geez, what are my chances?" (Laughter) And he could say, "Oh my God!" or "I heart you!"
"I'm laughing out loud."
"I want to give you a hug." But he comes up with that, you know. He tells her, "I'd like to hand-paint your portrait on a coffee mug."
I want to do a quick follow-up to the last video because I did not give a complete picture of all of the fiscal policy tools that a government has at its disposal.
Just to think about it in terms of the, in terms of the GDP expenditure components, we know that GDP,
GDP is equal to consumption, which is mostly consumers, individuals, investment, which is mostly firms, and some consumer spending on new houses. Then you have government expenditure, and then you have net exports, which kind of completes the picture. But what we described in the last video is these two things are held constant.
People, the government isn't fueling its expenditures with more taxes, so this part stays constant, but with the extra debt, the government spends more, so this part goes up, everything else holds roughly constant, and so GDP would go up. The other tool that the government has, has at its disposal, is to hold spending constant, so spending is held constant, and lowering taxes, and lowering taxes, which would essentially put more money in the hands of consumers of individuals, families, and firms. Once again, the only way they can do that, if you hold spending constant, and you're reducing your revenues, the only way they can do that is once again, taking on more debt.
GDP is equal to consumption plus investment plus government spending plus net exports, plus net exports, in this situation, government spending is held constant but because the consumers' and the firms' taxes have gone down, they have more to spend, and they will spend some component of it, and so these two pieces will go up, and GDP will go up.
I just wanted to make sure we added this picture right over here. Fiscal policy isn't just about increasing or decreasing government spending. It can also be about tax policy, increasing or decreasing taxes.
What I want to do in this video is revisit some ideas that you've probably taken for granted since the time that you were, like, three or four years old, but hopefully you'll kind of view it in a new light that will help inform us when we think about other types of number systems. So, we have ten digits in our number systems. Let me just start counting.
I use the symbol 1. Actually, let me draw this out. So nothing, then if I have one thing, I use the symbol 1.
system, so we start reusing them. So what we do is we reintroduce this idea of number places. You said that I have one ten and zero ones.
This is literally saying one, this is saying one tens, this is one tens plus zero ones. So that's what this is saying. But we didn't have to reuse it.
We have ten digits - zero through nine. How would we count in base two? So, if you have zero things, you'd still probably say
"hey, I have zero. I can use the digit zero." If I have one thing, I can still say
"hey, I have one thing"... because, we have the digits of zero and one.
So, let me make it clear. The digits here, the digits in base two, can be zero or one. So, if I have one thing, I can still use the number one.
So in base two, why can't we that we have one two - one two - and zero ones. So, this right here is saying one two and zero ones.
I want to make sure you understand the analogy here.
In base ten... let me write a larger number in base ten... ...and so if I write the number 256 in base ten... so, this is base ten over here, what does this say?
This is saying two hundreds, so, two times a hundred... or, maybe I should write down the word so I don't confuse the symbols... two hundreds plus five times... or maybe I should I say two hundreds plus five tens... two hundreds, plus five tens, plus six ones.
That's what I represent here, and the way we know that is that we know that if we go two places to the left, this is the hundreds place, this is the tens place, and this is the ones place. And if you know from your exponents, this is equal to ten times ten. This right here is equal to ten times itself only once and this is equal to ten times itself, I guess you could call it, zero times.
And if you added another digit here, that would be the thousandths place, which would be ten times ten times ten. We're going to do the exact same thing in base two but, instead of using ten, we're going to use two.
So, now this is the two's place. This is the two's place over here. This is the one's place.
So in base two... let me write a number in base two... remember, in base two I can only use zeros and ones.
So, in base two, maybe I have the number 1010. So, when you think about it this way, if this was base ten you would call this the ten's place, the hundred's place, and the thousandth's place. But, this is base two now.
So, in base two this right here is still the one's place now this is going to be the two's place remember, in base ten this was the ten's place, now this is the two's place. Now this would be, and you can take a guess here hundreds was ten times ten.
When we go two spaces to the left in base two this should be the two times two's place. Or this is the four's place. This over here is going to be the eight's place.
So, in base ten this would be... let me write it over here... in base ten this would be an eight plus a two, which is just a ten So, this is in base ten. This is how you'd represent what we know as this many things - as ten things.
This is how you'd represent it in base two.
This is how we know we would represent it in base ten. Now let's continue here, just to make sure we understand things. So, this many objects, well, in base two we have one... if you just have two objects - that's one two and zero ones... now three objects would be one two plus one ones.
So, let me do it over here, so this would be one two plus one ones. So, this is three objects in base two. Now when you go to this, so over here we have one four... zero twos and zero ones.
If we increment more, we have to go to one more place just like we did in base ten, but now we can only use the digits zero and one.
So, now we'll have one four, zero twos, zero ones. Now when we add one more, we're going to add one more one so, now we have one four, zero twos, and one one. and just to be clear, this is this many things.
This is this many things in base two, this is the four place one four and one one.
If you wanted to convert this into base ten, you'd say look "this is one four, zero twos, and one one."
So, if you have a four and a one, we would represent that with a symbol 5 in base ten, but we don't have that symbol to us in base two.
Let's go to this. So, now we're going to increment one more. So, how can we represent that in base two?
And if you keep it... it's kind of fun counting in base two, you'll start to get the hang of it. So, here we'll have to add one one to this so we get one, one, one. And now when we get to eight, there's no way to kind of increment any of these any higher, so we have to get a new place... we have to go to the eight's place.
So, we have one eight... zero fours, zero twos, and zero ones.
This right here, it might look like a thousand to you but it would be a thousand if we were in base ten.
In base two, this is this many objects. This is eight objects in base two. When you go... when you increment at one, we'll have this many, we'll have one eight, and then we'll have one one.
And then, I'll stop here, at what we consider to be ten objects.... in base two, you would say you have one eight, and you would need one two... so zero fours, one two, and zero ones. So, this right here is ten in base two. This is ten in base ten.
We're asked to find the square root of 100. Let me write this down bigger. So the square root is this big check-looking thing.
But you could write this as the square root of-- and instead of 100, 100 is the same thing as 10 times 10. And then you know, the square root of something times itself, that's just going to be that something. This is just equal to 10.
John Green: Hi, I'm John Green. This is Crash Course World History.
Yeah, Mr. Green, capitalism just turns men into wolves. Your purportedly free markets only make slaves of us all. Oh god, Stan, it's me from college.
The reason he's so unbearable, Stan, is that he refuses to recognize the legitimacy of other people's narratives, and that means that he will never, ever be able to have a productive conversation with another human in his entire life. Listen, me from the past, I'm going to disappoint you by being too capitalist, and I'm going to disappoint a lot of other people by not being capitalist enough, and I'm going to disappoint the historians by not using enough jargon. What can I do?
Randy Riggs becomes a best-selling author,
Josh Radnor stars in a great sit-com, it is not going to work out with Emily and do not go to Alaska with a girl you've known for 10 days.
Okay, let's talk capitalism. (music) Capitalism is an economic system, but it's also a cultural system.
Stan, I can't wear these emblems of the bourgeoisie while Karl Marx himself is looking at me, it's ridiculous. I'm changing.
Very hard to take off a shirt dramatically. Let's say it's 1200 C.E. and you're a rug merchant. Just like merchants today you sometimes need to borrow money in order to buy the rugs you want to resell at a profit, and then you pay that money back often with interest once you've resold the rugs.
By the 17th century, merchants in the Netherlands and in Britain had expanded upon this idea to create joint stock companies. Those companies could finance bigger trade missions and also spread the risk of international trade. The thing about international trade is sometimes boats sink, or they get taken by pirates.
Let's use Joyce Appleby's definition industrial capitalism:
An economic system that relies on investment of capital in machines and technology that are used to increase production of marketable goods. Imagine that someone made a Stan machine. By the way, Stan, this is a remarkable likeness.
That Stan machine could produce and direct ten times more episodes of Crash Course than a human Stan. Of course, even if there are significant up-front costs, I'm going to invest in the Stan machine so I can start cranking out ten times the knowledge. Stan are you focusing on the robot instead of me?
Stan, bud, you're going behind the globe. When most of us think about capitalism, especially when we think about its down sides; long hours, low wages, miserable working conditions, child labor, unemployed Stans, that's what we're thinking about.
Britain had a bunch of advantages. It was the dominant power on the seas and it was making good money off of trade with its colonies, including the slave trade. Also, the growth of capitalism was helped by the half-century of civil unrest that resulted from the 17th century English civil war.
(John makes vocal wer-wer-wer sound) So far all this sounds pretty good, right? I mean except for the child labor.
They had to come to believe that making an up-front investment in something like a Stan machine could pay for itself and then some. One of the reasons that these values developed in Britain was that the people who initially held them were really good at publicizing them.
Writers like Thomas Mun who worked for the English East India Company exposed people to the idea that the economy was controlled by markets. Other writers popularized the idea that it was human nature for individuals to participate in markets as rational actors. Even our language changed.
Perhaps the most important idea that was popularized in England was that men and women were consumers as well as producers, and that this was actually a good thing because the desire to consume manufactured goods could spur economic growth. "The main spur to trade, or rather to industry "and ingenuity, is the exorbitant appetite of men,
Socialism as an intellectual construct began in France.
How'd I do, Stan? In the border between Egypt and Lybia! There were two branches of socialism in France; utopian and revolutionary.
Utopian socialism is often associated with Comte de Saint Simon and Charles Fourier, both of whom rejected revolutionary action after having seen the disaster of the French Revolution.
While Fourier is usually a punchline in history classes because he believed that in his ideal socialist world the seas would turn to lemonade, he was right that human beings have desires that go beyond basic self interest and that we aren't always economically rational actors. The other French socialists were the revolutionaries, and they saw the French Revolution, even its violence, in a much more positive light. The most important of these revolutionaries was Auguste Blanqui.
We associate a lot of his ideas with communism, which was a term that he used.
Like the utopians, he criticized capitalism, but he believed that it could only be overthrown through violent revolution by the working classes. However, while Blanqui thought that the workers would come to dominate a communist world, he was an elitist, and he believed that workers could never, on their own, overcome their superstitions and their prejudices in order to throw off bourgeoisie oppression. That brings us to Carl Marx, whose ideas and beard cast a shadow over most of the 20th century.
An open letter to Carl Marx's beard. But first, let's see what's in the secret compartment today. Oh, Robot?
Two Stanbots, one of the female! Now I own all the means of production! You're officially useless to me, Stan.
Stanbot, go turn the camera off. Hey there, Carl Marx's beard. Wow!
Carl Marx, these days there are a lot of young men who think beards are cool, beard-lovers if you will. Those aren't beards, they're glorified milk mustaches. I haven't shaved for a couple weeks, Carl Marx, but I'm not claiming a beard.
Communist Manifesto, Marx was above all a philosopher and a historian. It's just that unlike most philosophers and historians, he advocated for revolution. His greatest work, Das Kapital, sets out to explain the world of the 19th century in historical and philosophical terms.
Marx's thinking is deep and dense and we're low on time, but I want to introduce one of his ideas; that of class struggle. For Marx, the focus isn't on the class, it's on the struggle. Basically, Marx believed that classes don't only struggle to make history, but that the struggle is what makes classes into themselves.
Marx was writing in 19th century England. There were two classes that mattered; the workers and the capitalists. The capitalists owned most of the factors of production; in this case, land and the capital to invest in factories.
By arguing that capitalism actually isn't consistent with human nature, Marx sought to empower the workers. That's a lot more attractive than Blanqui's elitist socialism.
While purportedly Marxist states, like the U.S.S.R., usually abandon worker empowerment pretty quickly, the idea of protecting our collective interest remains powerful. That's where we'll leave it for now lest I start reading from the Communist Manifesto.
In the United States, at least, socialism has become something of a dirty word. Industrial capitalism certainly seems to have won out, and in terms of material well-being and access to goods and services for people around the world, that's probably a good thing. Ah, you keep falling over.
How and to what extent we use socialist principles to regulate free markets remains an open question, and one that is answered very differently in, say, Sweden than in the United States. This, I would argue, is where Marx still matters. Is capitalist competition natural and good, or should there be systems in place to check it for the sake of our collective well being?
Let's do some slightly more complicated fractional exponent examples. So we already know that if I were to take 9 to the 1/2 power, this is going to be equal to 3, and we know that because 3 times 3 is equal to 9. This is equivalent to saying, what is the principal root of 9?
Simplify the expression using rational exponents. So we have the cube root of all of this stuff over here which would be the same thing, or which is the same thing by definition as all of this stuff 64 a to the 6th, b to the 3rd, c to the 9th, raised to the 1/3rd power. These are equivalent, by definition.
What you're going to do is, well, let me just show you.
If you do the prime factorization, you have 2 times 32, 32 is 2 times 16, 16 is 2 times 8, 8 is 2 times 4, 4 is 2 times 2, so you can have 2 multiplied by itself 3 times, or you could have a ..oh! a 2 multiplied by itself 3 times, and that happens twice, or you could have 4 times 4 times 4. So if you,you,it it didn't immediately jump into your head that 64 is 4 to the 3rd power, you can literally do a brute force prime factorization here and see that you have 6. You can factor this into 2 to the 6th power or, the same thing as 4 to the 3rd power.
We have our scale again, with some masses on the left-hand side, and some masses on the right-hand side and we see that our scale is balanced. We have the same total mass on the left-hand side that we have on the right-hand side. Instead of labeling the mystery masses with a question mark,
"Why don't I just remove two of them? Why don't I just remove that one and that one? Then I will just be left with that single one."
So you can make the conclusion, as you kept this thing balanced the whole time, that x = 3.
I was thirsty for some new experience and I decided to go to see Dubai.
I was really blown away by this place. I was actually so blown away that I wounded up right here. I was amazed by the technological precision with which the city was built on plain sand.
Today we see that the builders of Dubai have conquered the elements of nature with the use of state-of-the-art technology in architecture and engineering. We do live in amazing times, don't we? Day by day we improve our lives, we turn the impossible into the possible with the use of micro and macro technology.
- I actually could use it only for shadow, so there, that much I could derive from that tree of life - and one thing struck me because I realised that, if for some reason, I would wind up there completely cut off: no food, no water, nothing, just plain sand and palm trees around me, I wouldn't know how to get that coconut from the tree.
- there he is - climbed up on the top of the palm tree and disappeared over the leaves, and in a matter of seconds the coconut felt down on the ground. I was so much into my Robinson Crusoe anxiety that I felt really saved by this person. Yes, his knowledge could potentially save my life because there's no nutritious value of that coconut for me if it's hanging on the tree, and I don't know how to get it.
- imagine as though we were sitting on the Moon looking at it - it gives us some distance, some clarity. It actually never worked in my relationships, but trust me it works with any other thing. If you look at it from this perspective, there's one particular fundamental quality that becomes immediately evident: it is our togetherness, it is our interdependence, and the fact that we pass on our best experience to next generations.
"...when the oil is finished, we will have to base entirely on our skills, and our government is investing in this right now." When I lived and worked in Boston, I lived in a building that from ground floor to top floor was inhabited by students from China studying at MlT, Harvard, Boston University, you name it.
This reminded me that sharing best experience, education, is an investment. China understands today that what made its economy flourish yesterday, its cheap and competitive labor, will be able to be sustained tomorrow by a specialized workforce. While preparing this speech, with great pleasure,
"So you went to Cambridge? Oh my god, that's amazing! But how did you do that?
Cambridge was a life changing experience for me. I traveled and worked around the world. I spoke to innovative thinkers and doers who changed the way I look at the world.
But when I was 17-18 I knew nobody, nobody who could tell me what it is like there in Cambridge. Am I good enough to apply, and how should I do it? You see, as we speak, there are thousands of highly talented young people, in Poland and abroad, who are just about to make a paramount decision about what education path to choose.
"No, it's not as difficult as you think going to that university."
"Yes, I know how to do it, and I will help you because I have experience." So that they don't have to figure out how to climb that coconut tree, but they can get the knowledge exactly where it's needed, and answers to the questions from people who know how to answer them. So what if the youth somehow had access to top schools' networks?
Facebook, Gmail, Facetime, whatever, you name it, to help them in the process of applying: How to best fill out an application? Better to go to Oxford or Cambridge to study Chemistry?
100 is what percent of 80? These problems tend to kill people because on some level they're kind of simple, they're just 100 and an 80 there, and they're asking what percent. But then people get confused.
 Let's try to subtract 659 from 971. And as soon as you start trying to do it, you face a problem.
 Mario started the day with 5 fire flowers. He used some and now only has 3 left.
(Music)
(Applause) Thank you. Hi, everybody.
In the midst of hardship, it was the music that gave me -- that restored my soul. The comfort the music gave me was just indescribable, and it was a real eye-opening experience for me too, and it totally changed my perspective on life and set me free from the pressure of becoming a successful violinist. Do you feel like you are all alone?
(Applause) Thank you. Now, I use my music to reach people's hearts and have found there are no boundaries.
"Baroque in Rock," which became a golden disc most recently. It's such an honor for me. I think, while I'm enjoying my life as a happy musician,

I've always had a fascination for computers and technology, and I made a few apps for the iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad. I'd like to share a couple with you today. My first app was a unique fortune teller called Earth Fortune that would display different colors of earth depending on what your fortune was.
Bustin Jieber, which is â (Laughter) â which is a Justin Bieber Whac-A-Mole. I created it because a lot of people at school disliked Justin Bieber a little bit, so I decided to make the app. So I went to work programming it, and I released it just before the holidays in 2010.
First of all, I've been programming in multiple other programming languages to get the basics down, such as Python, C, Java, etc. And then Apple released the iPhone, and with it, the iPhone software development kit, and the software development kit is a suite of tools for creating and programming an iPhone app. This opened up a whole new world of possibilities for me, and after playing with the software development kit a little bit, I made a couple apps, I made some test apps.
One of them happened to be Earth Fortune, and I was ready to put Earth Fortune on the App Store, and so I persuaded my parents to pay the 99 dollar fee to be able to put my apps on the App Store. They agreed, and now I have apps on the App Store. I've gotten a lot of interest and encouragement from my family, friends, teachers and even people at the Apple Store, and that's been a huge help to me.
I've gotten a lot of inspiration from Steve Jobs, and I've started an app club at school, and a teacher at my school is kindly sponsoring my app club. Any student at my school can come and learn how to design an app.
So -- (Laughter) -- sorry -- (Laughter) -- so this is a resource to teachers, and educators should recognize this resource and make good use of it. I'd like to finish up by saying what I'd like to do in the future. First of all, I'd like to create more apps, more games.
Simplify: negative one times this expression in brackets negative seven plus 2 times 3 plus 2 minus 5 in parentheses, squared. So this is an order of operations problem, and remember in order of operations, you always wanna do parentheses first. Parentheses.
You could say, "hey, we have the parentheses, why don't we do them first" but when we just evaluate what's inside these parentheses you just get a negative 7, it doesn't really change anything. So we can just leave this as negative 7.
- and just to be clear: brackets and parentheses are really the same thing Sometimes people will write brackets around a lot of parentheses just to make it a little bit easier to read, but they are really just the same thing as parentheses. So these brackets are here,
Right now the prevailing theory of how the Universe came about is commonly called the Big Bang Theory. And really it's just this idea that the Universe that this Universe started as kind of an infintely small point, this infinitely small singularity, and then it just had a Big Bang, or it just expanded from that state to the Universe we know right now. And when I first imagined this, and I think it's also a by-product of how its named, Big Bang, you kind of imagine this type of explosion.
Let's write 113.9% (percent) as a decimal. So percent - this symbol right over here - literally means 'per hundred.'
Each time you divide by 10, you'd go one step to the left - which, hopefully, makes sense. If you were to multiply by 10, we would be moving the decimal over to the right. And there are other videos that go into far more depth on the intuition behind that.
The starting block below is 2 units long. Use the tools to the right to convert the starting block into both of the goal blocks, that are 5/8 units long, and 1 and 3/4 units long. You can see your progress as the current block.
Over 2000 years ago Euclid showed every number has exactly one prime factorization, which we can think of as a secret key. It turns out that prime factorization is a fundamentally hard problem. Let's clarify, what we mean by easy and hard, by introducing what's called time complexity.
What's in the box? Whatever it is must be pretty important, because I've traveled with it, moved it, from apartment to apartment to apartment. (Laughter) (Applause)
Ask ourselves, "Is that really going to make me happier? Truly?"
"Could I do with a little life editing?
Would that give me a little more freedom? Maybe a little more time?" What's in the box?
We're asked to convert these linear equations into slope-intercept form and then graph them on a single coordinate plane. We have our coordinate plane over here. And just as a bit of a review, slope-intercept form is a form y is equal to mx plus b, where m is the slope and b is the intercept.
In this video I want to familiarize you with the idea of a limit, which is a super important idea.
It's really the idea that all of calculus is based upon. But despite being so super important, it's actually a really really really simple idea. So let me draw a function here - actually, let me define a function here.
So once again that's a numeric way of seeing that the limit as x approaches 2 from either direction of g(x) - even though right at 2, the function is equal to 1, because it's discontinuous - the limit as we're approaching 2, we're getting closer and closer and closer to 4.
Let's review a little bit of what Napoleon was up to going into the war of the Third Coalition, which really does establish Napoleon as the dominant figure in Europe. So in 1799, he takes power. First with two other consuls, but then he declares himself First Consul.
We're told Ryan and Sabrina are running a race. Ryan runs three miles every 17 minutes. And we see that right over here.
நாம் பணம் மாற்று புரிந்து கொள்வதற்கு வசதியாக A மற்றும் B இரண்டு நாடுகள் இருப்பதாகவும் இரண்டு நாடுகளுக்கும் இடையிலான பண மாற்று விகிதம் ஒரே நிலையாக ஒன்றிற்கு ஒன்று என்ற சம அளவில் இருப்பதாகவும் வைத்துக் கொள்வோம். நாம் A நாட்டின் நாணயம் ஒன்றைக் கொடுத்தால் நமக்கு B நாட்டின் நாணயம் ஒன்று கிடைக்கும். எனவே இரண்டு நாணயங்களுக்கு இடையிலான பரிவர்த்தனை ஒரே சீராக இருக்கும். A நாட்டினர் தாங்கள் B நாட்டில் முதலீடு செய்வது நல்லது என்று நினைக்கிறார்கள். அதன்படி B இன் பங்குச் சந்தையில் முதலீடு செய்ய விரும்புகின்றனர். அப்படியானால் A நாட்டினர் B நாட்டின் நாணயத்தை அதிகமாக வைத்திருக்க வேண்டும்.
A நாட்டு மக்கள் B நாட்டு நாணயத்தை வாங்குகிறபோது நாணயச் சந்தையில் A இன் நாணயம் மேலும் மேலும் குவியும். அந்தத் தொகைக்கு ஏற்ப B நாடு A நாட்டில் முதலீடு செய்யவோ A யின் ஏற்றுமதிப் பொருட்களை வாங்கவோ B நாடு விரும்பலாம்கி. அல்லது வேறு எந்த வகையிலாவது அந்தப் பணத்தைப் பயன்படுத்திக் கொள்ளலாம். ஆனால் அப்படி ஒரே நேரத்தில் நடந்தால் பரிமாற்ற சந்தையில் பண நெருக்கடி ஏற்படும். A பணம் B ஆகவும் B பணம் A நாணயமாகவும் மாற்றப்படுகிற போது
A நாணயத்தின் மதிப்பை விடக் கூடுதலாக இருக்கும்
B நாணயத்தின் மதிப்பு. இப்போது ஒரு B நாணயத்தைப் பெற A செலுத்த வேண்டிய தொகை கூடுதலாக இருக்கும். இதற்குச் சமமான நிலைதான் B நாட்டிற்கும் ஏற்படும். ஒரு A நாணயத்தைப் பெற B செலுத்தும் தொகை அதிகமாக இருக்கும். இப்போது B நாட்டின் மத்திய வங்கி தனது நாணய மதிப்பு உயர்வதை விரும்பாது. பரிமாற்றச் சந்தையில் நாணயமதிப்பு சட்டென உயர்வதை விரும்பாமலும் இருக்கலாம். ஒரு நாடு தான் அதிகப் பணப் பரிவர்த்தனை செய்யும் நாட்டிற்கு ஏற்றுமதி செய்ய விருப்பமில்லாமல் அல்லது அதனிடமிருந்து இறக்குமதி செய்ய விரும்பாததும் காரணமாக இருக்கலாம். ஏனென்றால் வேறொரு நாட்டிலிருந்து இதைக் காட்டிலும் குறைவான விலைக்கு இறக்குமதி சாத்தியப்படலாம். இப்படி ஏதாவது ஒரு காரணத்திற்காக பண மாற்ற விகிதத்தில் திடீர் மாற்றத்தை ஒரு நாடு விரும்புவதில்லை. அது அதனுடைய பொருளாதார சுதந்திரம். அதன் பொருளாதார முடிவைத் தீர்மானிப்பது அந்நாட்டின் மத்திய வங்கி தான். நாணயத்தை அச்சடிக்கும் மத்திய வங்கி அவ்வப்போதைய தேவைக்கு நினைத்த நேரத்தில் நாணயத்தை அச்சிட்டுக் கொண்டிருக்க முடியாது.

B தனது நாணய மதிப்பை A இன் நாணய மதிப்புக்கு நிகராக வைத்திருப்பதில் வெற்றி பெறும். நாணயத்தின் மதிப்பைக் காப்பாற்றுவதைத் தானே ஒவ்வொரு நாடும் தமது இலக்காக கொண்டுள்ளன. ஆனால் B தனது நாணயத்தை அதிகமாக அச்சிட்டுக் கொண்டால் தான் A இடமிருந்து வெளிச் சந்தையில் பொருட்களை வாங்க முடியும். அந்நியச் செலாவணி இருப்பைப் பொறுத்தமட்டில் ஒவ்வொரு நாட்டின் மத்திய வங்கியும் பிற நாட்டு நாணயத்தை இருப்பில் வைத்துக் கொள்ளும். இதைத் தான் அந்நியச் செலாவணி இருப்பு என்கிறோம். ஒரு நாட்டின் மத்திய வங்கி தனது நாணயத்தை அச்சிட்டு அதனைக் கொண்டு பிற நாட்டு நாணயத்தை பரிவர்த்தனை சந்தை மூலமாகப் பெற்றுக் கொள்ளும். பிற நாட்டு நாணயங்களை இருப்பு வைப்பதற்கான காரணங்கள் நிறைய உண்டு. தனது நாணயமதிப்பைப் பாதுகாத்துக் கொள்வது ஒரு முக்கியமான காரணம். குறிப்பாக திடீரென்ற ஏற்ற இறக்கங்களில் இருந்து பாதுகாப்பதற்காக இருக்கும். இதுதான் அந்நியச் செலவாணியின் அடிப்படை.
 We're asked to simplify m to the third and then that squared all over mx to the third all of that to the fourth power. And they want us to express our answer in exponential form.
We recently launched Computer Science on Khan Academy. And I just wanted to show it off here, because I think it's one way that you can bring creativity, and interaction and discovery into the classroom. So here are a couple of ideas of how you could use
And there are tutorials on drawing and basics of programming and animation. And you can check those out or have your students check those out to get really simple and accessible explanations of Computer Science basics. Students can do all kinds of things once they're here.
What I have attempted to draw here is a unit circle and the fact I'm calling it a "unit circle" means it has a radius of one so this length here from the center, and I've centered it at the origin, this length, from the center to any point on the circle is of length one. so what would this co-ordinate be right over there? Right where it intersects along the x axis? well X would be one, Y would be zero (1,0) what would this co-ordinate be up here? well we've gone one above the origin, but we haven't moved to the left or the right... so our X value is zero, our Y value is one. what about back here? well here our X value is negative-one, we've moved one to the left and we haven't moved up or down so our Y value is zero and what about down here? well, we've gone one unit down (one below the origin) but we haven't moved in the X direction... so our X is zero, and our Y is negative-one. now with that out of the way, I'm going to draw an angle... and the way I'm going to draws this angle- I'm going to define a convention for positive angles.
When I was a child growing up in Maine, one of my favorite things to do was to look for sand dollars on the seashores of Maine, because my parents told me it would bring me luck.
But you know, these shells, they're hard to find. They're covered in sand, they're difficult to see. However, over time, I got used to looking for them.
Because all of the sudden, in Egypt, my beach had grown from a tiny beach in Maine to one eight hundred miles long, next to the Nile. And my sand dollars had grown to the size of cities. This is really what brought me to using satellite imagery.
Itjtawy was ancient Egypt's capital for over four hundred years, at a period of time called the Middle Kingdom, about four thousand years ago.
The site is located in the Faiyum of Egypt, and the site is really important, because in the Middle Kingdom there was this great renaissance for ancient Egyptian art, architecture and religion.
Egyptologists have always known the site of Itjtawy was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings who built it, indicated within the red circles here, but somewhere within this massive flood plain. This area is huge -- it's four miles by three miles in size. The Nile used to flow right next to the city of Itjtawy, and as it shifted and changed and moved over time to the east, it covered over the city.
What this shows is that at this possible location of Itjtawy, five meters down, we have a layer of occupation for several hundred years, dating to the Middle Kingdom, dating to the exact period of time we think Itjtawy is. We also found work stone -- carnelian, quartz and agate that shows that there was a jeweler's workshop here.
These might not look like much, but when you think about the most common stones used in jewelry from the Middle Kingdom, these are the stones that were used. So, we have a dense layer of occupation dating to the Middle Kingdom at this site. We also have evidence of an elite jeweler's workshop, showing that whatever was there was a very important city.
"Sharing knowledge is the greatest of all callings. There's nothing like it in the land." So as it turns out, TED was not founded in 1984 AD.
Find the perimeter of the parallelogram. We have a parallelogram right over here, opposite sides are parallel. That side is parallel to that side right over here.
12 + 8 is 20, 12 + 8 is 20, so this is all going to add up to 40 inches. And we're done. I guess this is a very small field, this is only 8 inches.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;THANlEL BlSHOP: Okay, so, Introduction to PV. We're going to talk about the development of
PV systems, kind of how they came to pass, essentially, and then the market, kind of where it is today, where it came from, and kind of where we expect it to go.
And then different PV applications and then the industry, the industry as far as workers in the industry. We've already talked about licensing but more on the industry, on the incentives, and that type of stuff.
And then different solar energy technologies, just so that we're clear on, of course, we're primarily focusing on photovoltaics but just want to talk about briefly the other solar technologies we have.
So, it started with selenium. The selenium photoconductive cells have a high resistance except when exposed to light, they became highly conductive.
This is kind of where photocells come from. You know the photocells that are on exterior light, so when the sun goes down, they click on.
This is essentially how those work. So, the first PV cells were developed in 1883 and were only one percent efficient.
So, this was really impractical for actual use of power production.
So, they were used in electronics just to, again, it was more of a control system, not for power production. And then in 1954, through Bell Laboratories, all of their research, they invented the first practical PV cell, which was producing at about six percent efficiency.
So, this is where it actually became practical enough to use as a power production source.
Although it was only six percent efficient, in some instances like the rural telephones and radio transmitters where it cost a lot to get power out to these little towns and areas.
Although the solar panels were only six percent efficient, they cost about $1,000 a watt to produce.
So, for instance, if this was a 100 watt solar panel, it's going to cost $100,000 to product this one.
So, they were very, very expensive but, at that time, that was still cheaper in some cases than running power hundreds of miles out somewhere.
So, these were primarily started getting put in in the 1950s and it just slowly moved on from there. The efficiencies have gone up, their applications have gone up as well. So, a very common application for solar was satellites.
So then earth-bound and space PV technologies have diverged quite a bit since then. They started in the same area and they're quite a lot different.
The reason being is, there's a lot more money that can be put into the solar for the space systems and then they're in a completely different environment than an earth-bound system. They're a lot colder. Being in outer space, they're a lot closer to the sun, they don't have to deal with the environment of the earth.
So, they tend to use a lot more expensive equipment for the space-bound systems. Different PV applications, I'm sure you've all seen the portable PV systems on RV. They're small and they're intended for specific loads.
But we have RV. I'm sure we've all seen the construction signs, these are all solar powered. So, these temporary signs.
These are getting a lot more common and a lot more reliable, actually, these portable chargers for small hand-held devices or other devices.
You can kind of see the solar panel here on this tent where these you can actually roll up, put in your backpack and if you go camping
like this, then you just unroll it, lay it on your tent, and it's going to keep your electronics charged up. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;STUDENT:
They are flexible? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;BlSHOP:
Yes. Yup, it's just, this is a thin film.
We'll talk more about this but, yeah, it's just basically, typically, depending on the brand you're getting, it's about five feet for a portable one and it just rolls up, just like a thick rubber.
So, they're really durable, you could walk on them. They're about, per watt they're about the same cost as a standard one.
How expensive are they? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;BlSHOP:
Another common place is remote areas where, for instance, these off-grid homes.
Homes that the power is too far away, it's going to cost too much to have power lines run to the house or to a cabin so it's much cheaper to put in solar PV.
This is where it's very, very cost effective. I've seen multiple jobs, I've had multiple jobs, where, for instance, we had an off-grid house, it wasn't just a cabin, this was a full time home that the client was living in and he got a quote from Rocky Mountain Power and he was over a mile off the grid and, to get power to him, it was $80,000 from the grid to his house, just for them to install the lines.
After that, because they installed them, they had a monthly minimum fee to help recuperate those costs plus the cost of the power.
So, we were able to install a system for a little more than that, being it was a full tracker system.
It was two large trackers like the ones you'll see out in the lab, that track the sun and he has a propane generator and now he produces his own power for again just a little bit more than that cost and he doesn't have the monthly fees, he doesn't have to pay for his power, it's done. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;STUDENT:
Did he have battery back up? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;BlSHOP: Yes, yes, he had battery backup.
Very large, he had 64 batteries installed. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;STUDENT:
long life batteries now? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;BlSHOP:
Here and there, they're getting used but not too commonly just because they're not cost effective, they still do cost a lot of money. But batteries, any battery in general does.
Still the most common type of battery in solar is the wet cell, the flooded lead acid.
So, they tend to last, they last the longest, they're work horses.
If they're maintained properly, they can last a good 10 years. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;STUDENT: How do they look, those batteries?
Like the ones that they use, for example, like for forklifts or bigger than that? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;BlSHOP:Do they use the type they use for forklifts? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;STUDENT:
No, no, no, I mean how does, what is the size of those batteries? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;BlSHOP:
Oh, okay, the physical size of the batteries. There's all multiple sizes, depending on the application.
They can come in, you can get them about the size of a car battery, others are the size of a diesel truck battery, so, it's two car batteries together. For an off-grid home like these, they tend to use batteries, let's see, I don't have anything. It's about almost four car batteries put together. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;STUDENT:
So, when you say 68 batteries, 68 of those batteries? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;BlSHOP:
They're about 18 inches tall, 15 inches wide, and about six inches thick. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;STUDENT:
How many kilowatts was that?
What was the wattage? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;BlSHOP: Of the solar system? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;STUDENT:
Let's see, I'll have to think about it a minute.
The size, for that off-grid system,
I believe it was just about a five kilowatt system. It wasn't too big at all. The idea with that, that's why we put a tracker system in.
I shouldn't say rare but it's a situation where the tracker system was well worth the money. A tracking system, we'll talk about those more, do cost a significant amount more money and, obviously, they produce more power because they're constantly tracking the sun, they get a higher, a lot more radiation.
But the cost of the tracker initially and then the maintenance typically isn't cost effective to the amount of power you gain.
If you need that much power, the cheaper way to do it is actually to add a few more solar panels to your fixed array.
But in that situation, with the trackers, we were very, very limited on space so we used the highest efficiency modules, the best we could get and we put in trackers because we couldn't just add more modules.
We had this much space so we had to maximize what we had. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;STUDENT: How long ago did you do that system? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;BlSHOP: How long ago did we install that?
That one was about six years ago. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;STUDENT: So it would be a lot cheaper now? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;BlSHOP: Yes, yes, it would be a lot cheaper.
Significantly cheaper. Module prices, the price of a solar panel, solar module, in the last four or five years has probably dropped about 75 percent. So, it's dropped quite a bit. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;STUDENT:
The solar panels are not actually located on the house itself.
Sometimes the house doesn't have a [inaudible].
In this picture, you can see the solar panels are on the house, on the roof.
The other thing I run into a lot with off-grid homes is they're in trees. The house is covered in trees, which is great because it's keeping the house nice and cool. So, you put your solar system away from the house where it's exposed to the sun and run your power lines into the house. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;STUDENT:
So, it would seem to me that, like, in those cases, the one on the left would be more efficient because you can actually have a lot more control about whether or not, how far it faces the south. Would that be true? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;BlSHOP: Yes, it is an advantage with putting it out away from the house, yes, because you can control that it's facing due south and you can control it's tilt angles very, very easily.
And then the tilt of the roof.
But more and more off-grid homes, if they're going to be putting solar in like this one, they'll build the house for solar in mind.
So they'll face their roof due south and they'll put it on the proper tilt.
Because this is, if you put the solar on the roof, it's much, much cheaper. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;STUDENT: Less voltage drop. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;STUDENT:
Is there an effect on, like, the height that the solar panels sit at?
So, like, verses having a solar panel on the ground verses higher above the ground, does that affect efficiency? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;BlSHOP: It can, depending on the application, again. The cooler a panel is, the more efficient it is. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;STUDENT:
The what? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;BlSHOP: The cooler it is. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;STUDENT: Colder? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;BlSHOP:
The hotter a solar modules gets, the efficiency drops. So, they like the sunlight but they don't like the heat. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;STUDENT:
So, the colder it is, the more efficient it is. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;BlSHOP: So, typically, and that's another advantage to not having it on the house is because it can cool itself down quicker verse being installed on a roof, it has a harder time keeping itself cool. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;STUDENT:
I don't know, how do you assemble that or how they go on the roof but I believe that you need to drill or something like that. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;BlSHOP: Right, yeah, the ability for it to be hooked to the roof, it's a completely different set up than if it's out by itself. And there's lots and lots of different types, attachment types you can use.
And we'll talk about those a lot in mechanical integration, we'll go through all the primary ones out on the market.
Is there a question? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;STUDENT: Is there a limit to that idea that the colder it is, the more efficient it is?
So, if it gets below &amp;gt;&amp;gt;BlSHOP:
Yes, yes, there is a limit to how, how far you go, how cold you'll get until it continues to, the efficiency stops going up. It's not, we usually don't reach those limits much. The primary thing that happens with the efficiency is our voltage continues to rise as our temperature drops.
Where if something like this wasn't taken into account, that it gets extremely cold here, you can have your voltage rise too high and burn your equipment up. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;STUDENT:
Do you ever often include thermal solar with the panels that conduct the heat away from the panels? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;BlSHOP:
There are more and more of those BlPV type or BT, it's a PVT, there's all different types. The BlPV is Building Integrated Photovoltaics. But there's PVT which is Photovoltaics Thermal.
And that's a type of system where they have a solar panel, a solar module that produces power and then they integrate thermal behind that just to do that, not only does it remove the heat to help the solar power run more efficient but then they take that heat, put it in a heat exchanger and use that heat to heat the home.
So, this one here, you can see on the bottom it's photovoltaics and on the top it's thermal.
Now, you can barely see it but this is, these are all completely independent with the PV technology and a thermal technology. But, yeah, more and more we're seeing it.
What they've done is they've taken thermal, like a coil and we put that on the decking on the roof and then we took our shingles and covered the whole thing. So you don't even know that there's solar thermal there.
And what it does is it just sucks the heat right out of the roof.
Then there's no solar thermal panels, it just looks like you have a regular roof. That same company makes a universal type of, it's like a radiator, it's hermetically sealed, though.
It's a stainless steel where it will actually go behind any, not any but most standard solar modules.
So you would install the solar thermal on your racking that has an inlet and an outlet for your glycol mixture or your antifreeze and then you would install your solar PV right over the top of it.
So it's going to help draw the heat away from your PV and then that's used again for radiant floor heating, for domestic hot water, wherever you need it. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;STUDENT:
What company is that? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;BlSHOP: That one who helped us with our lab is Sol-Ice. They have Sol-Ice Engineering Systems.
They do ice melting systems so they're usually pushing heat up onto the roof to melt the ice and they reversed everything in their technology for in the summer to suck the heat out of the roof and had really good success with it.
So, now they do both. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;STUDENT:
If you have both opportunities to choose between solar and wind energy, which one would you more? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;BlSHOP:
It's very due to the sun exposure and then the wind exposure. Wind, I'm not an expert in wind.
But with wind, lots of things have to be taken into account.
With the turbulence, you need a steady consistent wind over, at minimum it's 10 mile an hour, plus, almost constantly for it to be effective. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;STUDENT:
But if you have both opportunities, you have enough sun and enough wind, which one would you more? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;BlSHOP: Solar. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;STUDENT:
Solar? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;BlSHOP: If it was sixes on production-wise, you're saying, wind verses solar?
I would choose solar because there's no moving parts, there's no maintenance. All wind generators, it's rotating. Bearings need to be greased.
So there's more maintenance that goes into it, it's a lot more effort. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;STUDENT: Economically? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;BlSHOP: No, just maintenance.
But again, that's my personal opinion. So, again, off-grid homes.
Another real common is water pumping. So, here where you would need a water pump for livestock where you don't want to be running power clear out to the middle of a field to water the livestock.
And here's just another example.
These are typically very, very simple systems where the solar panels are directly connected to a DC pump and it just pumps the water. Keeps the watering holes full. I'm sure you've seen these on the side of the freeways.
I know that UDOT deals with these a lot, where it's just for monitoring.
Here we're monitoring wind speeds. It could be used for traffic cameras, seeing snow levels.
All sorts of different monitoring systems, it's really common to use just a few solar modules like this because not a lot of power is needed, but they need a little constantly to run that equipment. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;STUDENT: Quick question. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;BlSHOP:
On those, you were just talking about, are they often battery backup, do they have a battery storage for that? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;BlSHOP:
Yes, most of the time, these do have a battery storage.
If you see, there's quite a few signs where, some of them have the schools flashing lights and they have a big old box up high on the sign, right underneath the solar modules, that usually houses the controller and the batteries.
Another application. Utility scale applications. They're getting more and more popular.
They're catching on more due to the drop, the cost of the solar PV coming down, it's just dropped so much, it's a lot more cost effective.
But it is limited to certain areas due to where you have a high, high sun. There's other things that come into account. Wind storms.
These are very expensive to replace. But, again, it is a common thing. The other downside to a large-scale PV is it's not a constant power.
Like a power plant is providing power 24 hours a day. A solar PV power plant is only going to provide power when the sun's up.
So, as soon as the sun goes down, it goes off line. That's the biggest [inaudible], right, unless you store it. And for a utility scale like this, it's not a thing is very feasible to store.
So, the way they typically use these is they still have their main power plants running but they don't have to run nearly as much during the day because the solar PV's picking up that load.
Does that make sense? All right, the market. So, with different types of
And what that means is it does not include batteries. That is the biggest thing.
It does not have batteries because it's only going to work with utility, utility-interactive.
So, when the grid goes down, so does the PV system. This is a safety feature where, if the grid goes out, the power company, they have a line that comes down so a whole block or your house loses its power, we don't want to continue to produce power because we're going to be pushing that power into your home, powering your loads, but the remainder is going to go through the power lines and energize the other side of that power line.
So, you have a line worker that doesn't know if it's energized or not.
When it leaves your house, sure it's only the 120, 240 volts, but what lots of people don't understand is not far from you house there's a transformer that's going to bump that up and, depending on where that
line's broken, you could be bumping up, off of your
little solar system on your house, you could be providing 7,000 volts down the line quite easily to a line worker that's going to get killed. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;STUDENT:
I'd think there's be a way to safely, you know, break the connection if the power on the grid goes down.
Do they have those safety? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;BlSHOP: Absolutely, yes, with the battery backup system, they have transfer switches that you can put in place that would then, if the power goes down, it's going to disconnect your house from the grid so you have power but you're not hooked up to the utility company.
And that would be a battery backup system, not a standard utility interactive. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;STUDENT: Assuming you had enough power generation to run you freezer or whatever's in your house you wanted to, would it be able to, are there systems that, without a battery backup, just operate the essentials in your house with just the photo, the PV? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;BlSHOP:
Yeah, if you just want to operate the, a select number of loads, like you said, if we just wanted to run say the refrigerator and the furnace and the lighter too, so when the power goes out, you just have your essentials, absolutely.
Nine out of 10 times, that's exactly what we do is we will find the selected loads and we put them in their own little box and we power those when it goes down.
We have a small solar system, we don't want to be powering every light in the house and the air conditioner, and not everything needs power.
And it costs a lot more to provide that. Shelise, you have a question? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;STUDENT:
Now, they put transformers on business buildings, right? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;BlSHOP:
And I know we talked about in the class that having transformers close to animals or livestock sometimes caused problems.
Did you talk just a little about that? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;BlSHOP: I know that got brought up in the last class, I don't remember specifically. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;STUDENT:
So, why wouldn't they use transformers on a residential setting to increase the efficiency of the solar panel? Like, why wouldn't you just put the solar panel up, take what the amount of electricity you're getting and then up it for you house?
Is it dangerous to do that? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;BlSHOP:
Well, we do do that, with a solar system, we do take the power it's giving and through an inverter, which has the transformers built into it, it'll bump it to the voltage that you're using in your house. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;STUDENT: Oh, so the transformer, maybe I'm confused a little bit.
The transformer just takes the voltage up or down but it doesn't necessarily make something more efficient or give you more power. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;BlSHOP:
Correct. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;STUDENTS: [inaudible] &amp;gt;&amp;gt;BlSHOP:
Yes, yeah, so the transformer, just like you said, it's just transforming our voltage from one voltage to another. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;STUDENT:
But you need amperage to get the, more power. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;BlSHOP: Typically, minus the efficiency loss of a transformer, your power in's your power out.
Oh, yeah, about that switch that separates the utility power from your solar power, would that be an automatic switch or one that you would have to go switch yourself? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;BlSHOP: There are manual transfer switches and automatic transfer switches. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;STUDENT:
So, if you it happens when you're not at home, it will do it by itself. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;BlSHOP:
Most of the systems that are getting put in are automatic transfer switches.
Most of the ones nowadays, more and more, you don't even know they switch, some of them in a sixteenth of a second, some of them are faster. Lots of them, the last few we put in, the one we have here on site, when we shut the power off just to simulate a power outage, there's not even a flicker in the lights.
You have no idea the power went out. But, you're right. That would be the advantage to that is if you're gone, you don't want to be gone for the weekend, the power goes out and you come home and all your food in your freezer's gone bad, right?
It'll automatically switch itself if that's what you want it to do. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;STUDENT: On the utility interactive, isn't most of this handled in the converter? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;BlSHOP:
On the utility interactive, yes. All these control systems are typically housed in the inverters now. So, the electricity that's going back to the grid, is that going back on the same lines that the electricity's coming to the grid from normally? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;BlSHOP:
Yes, yeah, so the question was does the power come out on the same line that the power's coming in on and absolutely.
In a normal operation, here we have our service that's powering the house, well then what's going to happen if we produce power and we don't use all that power in the home, the remaining power will go back out into those power lines, finding a way to complete the circuit. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;STUDENT:
No, it's just sending the power the other direction. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;STUDENT:
You're using less power from the utility company, you're not necessarily using less power in general. Just so they have the power, they can't tell the difference.
You can see here where, in red, red is a utility interactive, just a basic grid-tie system. Yellow is the off-grid. You can see that it's mostly stayed the same over the last, this is over a four year period.
But you can see the red's almost doubling, not quite but pretty close, each year. It's just constantly jumping up and jumping up. And this is in the amount that has been installed.
Not the number of systems, it's just the amount of gig watts being installed. So, the other thing that's driving this, it's not so much that we're getting that much more small residential systems, which we are getting a lot, it's also large utility scale systems are becoming more popular.
Large businesses where they end up putting a 10, a 50, a 100 kilowatt solar system on their roofs, is getting a lot more common as well.
If you're interested, again, in the statistics, in where the PV market is, really, really good resource is Solarbuzz. If you Google Solarbuzz, I believe it's solarbuzz.com but I'd have to double check. They keep up on all this, on each market with the
All that, it's just a fact website about solar. It's a really good resource.
So, the cost of modules, you can see as I was talking, is continually falling and falling pretty fast. So, after lots of improvement in, it's not so much the technology, the technology is growing and improving, but it's primarily the way we're manufacturing it. We can manufacture it faster, more efficiently, so the cost to manufacture them is what's dropping.
So again, $1,000 per watt in the 1960s is what we were averaging to, this says lower than $3 a watt now which it's
lower than that. There's solar modules on the market. You go to the bottom lines one, not the top, you're under $1 a watt for some. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;STUDENT:
So, how much are you thinking that drop in wattage is because we've shipped a lot of that to China? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;BlSHOP: How much, I'm not- &amp;gt;&amp;gt;STUDENT: I mean like, we started, like, that magazine you just had.
You know, this whole article is on how they're doing tariffs on China because they were selling the solar panels so much cheaper than us. Do you think that a lot of the cost drop was due to the fact that we were manufacturing in a foreign country? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;BlSHOP:
Yeah, when China got in the market, we saw module prices, that's what in the
This chart only goes, this goes up to January, January 2012.
So you can see this right here, over the last few years, was definitely driven by that and that's why they put the tariffs in place was because the American manufacturers couldn't keep up with those prices. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;STUDENT:
A lot of it too has got to be the new software for factory animation and solar, in particular. And they drop price of the lot because of that, it's just so much more efficient. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;BlSHOP: Yeah, yeah, there's a lot more, when we get into the module manufacturing, we'll see how lots of it's just the robotics.
There's not a lot of manpower going into it, as much as there used to be and that's brought the price down a lot as well. But, yeah, China's really driven it down. There's lots of talk of it actually coming up a little bit now that these tariffs are in place and kind of meeting in the middle with a higher end
American manufacturer or a high end German manufacturer where, it's not just the American modules, its just a higher end module where no one's buying them because they can get the other stuff for pennies on the dollar. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;STUDENT:
And that's what a lot of people don't understand.
Just because you have a 200 watt solar module from this brand and a 200 watt solar module from this brand, lots of people think, well, that's 200 watts and that's 200 watts.
Well, there's a lot more, it's not always apples to apples. Because, like you said, it's quality. How long's it going to last?
And that reason, especially is a big reason I see why people don't want to buy Chinese modules because lots of these Chinese brands haven't been around nearly as long as these other bigger names. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;STUDENT:
Have you noticed a difference then, in the quality over a few years? Like a Chinese brand verses this high end brand to install, do you even notice a quality? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;BlSHOP:
In some Chinese modules, yes. I've put in my share of China modules, of Japanese modules, American modules, and there is, most of them are, the ones that I've put in,
I try to only install and buy modules that I've seen their warranty, their tiers on, how theyre going to stand behind that module.
It's not just the module specs of how well it will perform but you look into the company to see how long they've been around and when this module goes out in 15 years and they give it a 30 year warranty, are they still going to be around to back it up.
And theres plenty of manufacturers that, they're dropping off, they're not around anymore.
But there are a few where they are China produced, and again it's a very few that I've seen that I've been able to look into, but they are, German engineering stands behind it.
There are a few manufacturers where, it's a German module but they've moved their production to China under those same standards.
So, they still have the good warranty, they're still a good company and those, if I get Chinese modules, those are the ones I look at. All right, so worldwide cell production.
You can see about where everything is but global cell production has increased 108 percent with crystalline silicon and thin film up by 62 percent.
So, overall cell manufacturing capacity rose 70 percent in 2010. This is the megawatt of cell production in each of these companies.
So, we have Japan.
Over 800 megawatts cell production. Europe, over 400. U.S., probably about 150, 175.
So you can see Japan is, they produce a lot of solar. They have Sanyo and Sharp and Kyocera and they've been in solar for a very, very long time. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;STUDENT: What is it, is there a way to find out what brands are made where?
[inaudible] a list of those companies and where they're made at? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;BlSHOP:
Magazine or even Photon Magazine where they will give you, and this is an advantage of having a trade magazine, is they'll do research on modules and give you a list of which ones are produced here, here, and here.
Who has the best warranty? They'll give you 100 different module manufacturers in a spreadsheet and compare them side by side, which is really valuable information. And then beyond that, you can go, and there's lots of manufacturers where they'll tell you where they're produced.
Sharp and Sanyo, yes, they are Japanese modules but they do have an American line that they produce here in the States. So it's all U.S. made but it's done by, again,
Sharp or Kyocera has one and, again, Sanyo. So, this is the global market as far as the, how much PV's installed in these countries and what they're having put in.
You can see Germany is still a leader. This is as of 2010. So as of 2010, you have Italy in second place and Germany doubles Italy's solar.
It's interesting, Japan's the biggest industry and utilize the least.
I figured Japan would be up more but- &amp;gt;&amp;gt;STUDENT: That's because they don't have as much land as we do so they can't actually use solar as much as easily because there's no land. They can't even bury their own dead because it's so small.
Germany just, they cover square inch with solar power that they can. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;STUDENT:
Does this chart represent the manufacturing or the usage? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;BlSHOP: This is the market, this is the market in each of those, as far as what that country has purchased in solar. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;STUDENT:
So it is actually the same price to do it Germany that do it here in the United States or it's basically the same? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;BlSHOP: With the solar modules, it's pretty much the same.
The thing that changes is the inverters, is the electrical equipment. If you go over in Germany, they have completely different codes and electrical codes, so they're on completely different standards. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;STUDENT: They run DC? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;BlSHOP:
More countries are on 50 hertz than on 60. And, then again, just the regulations are going to affect price dramatically.
So, if anything, it's actually a lot cheaper there, cost of power and the equipment requirements are going to change significantly. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;STUDENT: So, basically, what is the reason that here in the United States we are not doing that? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;STUDENT:
It's primarily, I'd say, just the different regulations that we have here.
We're, again, we're on our own type of power. We're running 120, 240 volts at 60 hertz. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;STUDENT: But our power is also cheaper in the US than in those other countries. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;BlSHOP:
Yeah, it's all about the money. So, again, this is just more on the market. The on-grid market has been Germany where demand has been stimulated by very attractive feed in tariffs.
So Japan's about all the same on that last chart. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;STUDENT:
So, US market almost doubled in 2010, but we're still, global market decreased to five percent in 2010. So, we still don't have the most, not even close to it, but still our market by itself is growing very, very fast. This is utility scale, 54 percent.
And again, all these are from Solarbuzz. Wind power capacity was added in '09 and then the grid-connected PV increased fastest from the end of '04 to '09. So here, on the left, I don't know if you can barely see these, but we have solar PV grid-tie systems and the orange is just what happened in 2009.
So blue is five years, orange is one year. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;STUDENT: Isn't California the leading state that does solar? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;BlSHOP: And they have the best grid-tie [inaudible]? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;BlSHOP:
Solar thermal power, just in that one year, four times as much in '04 to '09. So, it's interesting. US power rates, this is as of '09.
I believe now, a few of these states have passed us up in they cost more than us. So, but that's always doing this. But we are on the low end still of cost of power.
You can see how, in the 80s, they jumped up and they were on a decline up into 2000 and then it's continually raised from there.
City has been on an average increase of anywhere, I believe it's six to eight percent per year they have been increasing consistently.
If anyone saw this article where Rocky Mountain's put in a request to increase the cost of power and they want it to increase eight to 10 percent annually for the next 10 years.
So they're expecting an eight to 10 percent increase every year for the next 10 years. So, they expect 100 plus percent increase in the next 10 years of cost of power in Utah. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;STUDENT:
So, when you out and install people's stuff, do you do it, a lot of times, educating people about this? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;BlSHOP:
Yes, yeah, educating the customer is, it's a key point to selling the systems but really so they understand what they're getting themselves into, so they know why they're investing $20,000 to a solar system on their roof.
Because it is a lot of money. But, yeah, we spend a lot of time, and some customers more than others, depending on how interested they are in it. The PV industry's broken up into quite a few different tiers or blocks like this flow chart.
They're typically going to an integrator or, more and more commonly, not directly to the integrators anymore, it's a distributor. So, you have a distributor, just like any other industry, with plumbing and electrical, you're going to have your supply houses or distributors that are going to be purchasing in large quantities from the manufacturers and then selling those to integrators.
And, in Utah, integrators and installers are usually the same guy, same person, same company.
But in more and more, in Utah it's happening more, especially in California and back east in New Jersey, integrators and installers are different. An integrator is the one that's going to come in and fully design it. Those are more or less the engineering and then the installers are the contractors out there really doing the work.
The SunShot initiative, I recommend if you're interested, go to this link, this website.
This is a career map, a solar career map. Kind of tells you, if you want to get to each of these dots, you have an entry level, an mid level, and an advanced level of all of these things. Here we have component production on the left.
System design, marketing, sales, and permitting and then installation operations. So, each of these dots represents a specific job position that is in the market today.
And if you click on that position, it'll tell you what you need to do to get to that position, what certification you'd need and kind of how you would get there.
It would give you a map, like a road map, if this is your goal, this is how you'd do it. All the equipment should be UL listed.
There's still quite a few, especially solar modules, on the market that are not UL listed. You can get on the internet and there's Do It Yourself and build a solar panel at home.
They work, I've seen them. They don't work as well. They're not hermetically sealed.
If you were to be purchasing your own equipment, it's just something you really want to make sure, just because you're getting the solar module and the inverter on a great deal, we've seen it where they're not listed.
You can still buy, not homemade ones, ones right from China, other places that they were not UL listed and you can get them dirt cheap and it causes problems. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;STUDENT:
So, you can't, when you say you can't get the permit, that means you can't plug it into the power grid. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;BlSHOP: You can get a permit but when they come to look at it, depending on the requirements to get a permit, lots of, nine out of 10 municipalities that I've seen, are going to require, they do require a line diagram and all the details about the job.
And then you have to provide the spec sheets for your modules and your inverters and show that they are UL listed. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;STUDENT:
So, if they're not UL listed, you can still power your house but you can't install it back to the grid. Is that right or no? You wouldn't be able to use it at all if you went through permitting and inspections.
UL listed are going to cause fires.
Hello. In this series of presentations, I'm gonna try to teach you everything you need to know about triangles and angles and parallel lines and this is probably the highest-yield information that you could ever learn, especially in terms of the standardized tests. And then when we've learned all the rules we'll play something I call the Angle Game, which is essentially what the SAT makes you do over and over again.
Let's go little bit into how we can tell whether our body is processing glucose properly And whether or maybe we have diabetes And I want you all to take all of this with a huge grain of salt because I am not a doctor, this is not medical advice
"blood sugar", we are talking about glucose So let me draw a couple of points on this chart So maybe this is 50, and our unit is going to be milligrams per decilitre (mg/dL)
I heard my wife say this word without knowing what it meant they sometimes say "preprandial" Which is a very fancy word, which just means "before a meal" "preprandial" is literally "before eating"
After the meal, you'll talking "postprandial" A very fancy word, for a very simple idea, eating So let's say at hour 2, this individual eats breakfast
So once again, this is normal and of course, don't freak out if you were to take a blood test one morning and you're like 85 mg/dL you're still not far off from normal, so obviously there's some variation from person to person Now, if someone has diabetes, if either they have Type I, they don't have enough insulin to actually process the glucose or, if they have enough insulin, but their body is desensitised the insulin is not being processed, so they can't process the glucose
We'll see that the glucose concentration will go up And so in general, if you were to wake up one morning after not having eaten for more than 8 hours and you were to prick your finger with little glucose monitors you can get at the drug store And in your finger, the blood sugar levels, if you're to find them to be
So you're fasting, blood sugar is around this line right here remember, the fasting blood sugar, not after you've eaten
Preprendial, before meal if it is above that threshold right over there, then you should definitely at least see a doctor and make sure they can see if you have diabetes but this will be cause for concern Another thing is that after a meal it spikes well beyond that if we're talking it gets above 180 you know, once again, these are just thresholds that, you know, doctors have come up with and researchers have come up with and say, "hey this is a good indication that somehow you're not processing glucose properly" so 180, 180 is up here, I'm drawing this is a squiggly line 'cause it's kind of a range you know, it's not like if your blood glucose is 124 you're safe and all of a sudden 125 you have diabetes you know they're not that different from each other, but they have to set up some thesholds so that, just to kind of have a threshold I guess so if your blood sugar, after eating a meal, were to spike up to 200 once again, that would be cause for concern In general, if someone has diabetes because they're not processing the glucose properly their blood glucose might look something like this
So if someone has blood sugar like this, they're probably diabetic and if someone has blood sugar like this, they should be worried Once again, I'm not a doctor, don't take any of this as an advice This is really just our attempt to understand things a little bit better
Do you ever feel completely overwhelmed when you're faced with a complex problem? Well, I hope to change that in less than three minutes. So, I hope to convince you that complex doesn't always equal complicated.
So here's a food web, or a map of feeding links between species that live in Alpine Lakes in the mountains of California. And this is what happens to that food web when it's stocked with non-native fish that never lived there before. All the grayed-out species disappear.
Let's multiply 4 times 2012. Actually, let's make it a little bit simpler, let's multiply 4 times 201. Just to simplify things a little bit.
Write 5.1/4 as an improper fraction Let me remind you an improper fraction is one where the numerator is gretaer than or equal to denominator, absolute value of numerator is greater than or equal to absolute value of denominator In this situation right here we have a mixed number where 5 is the whole number and 1/4 is a proper fraction as numerator is less than denominator
To write it as a improper fraction Divide each of the wholes into 1/4ths This is 4, 1/4ths, another 4,1/4ths another 4,1/4ths this is another 4, 1/4ths.
and then we can add to that 1/4ths. Then we will get 21/4. That is the conceptual way of how it works.
I've done a bunch of videos now on inflation and deflation and how they can be impacted by capacity utilization. And the traditional notion of capacity utilization, and this is what my brain does when someone mentions it, is I think of industrial capacity utilization. I imagine factories.
But in a service-based economy like we have here in the U.S. and like we have in a lot of Western societies, most of our real capacity for what we produce, or our GDP, is service based, because we're a service-based economy. And if you think about it, industrial capacity utilization, it matters, but it matters much more to manufacturing-based economy. In a service-based economy, the best measure of utilization really is unemployment.
With that said, I think it's really important to have a deeper understanding of how unemployment is measured and how it's thought about from the Government, and the numbers you hear on CNN, what they really mean in terms of the real unemployment picture. And most of these charts, actually all of these charts that I have in this video, I got from Mike Shedlock, who runs the Global Economic Analysis blog. And I had a conversation with him on Friday and he pointed out some really interesting things.
And he does a lot of this, where he looks at the economic data, but he goes several levels deeper than anyone really would go, especially on TV. But that's what you really have to do to really discern what matters.
And I want to give him full credit because he really is who pointed out a lot of this to me, but I think it's very instructive to the capacity utilization and inflation-deflation argument that I've been making. So right here I have a screenshot from the Bureau Of Labor Statistics and you could go there, just do a search for them.
And the number that you hear reported, at least since 1994, is U-3, and that's where we'll start.
That's kind of the official rate of unemployment. I know you can't read this properly. My screen capture software doesn't do well with this font.
But U-3 is total unemployed as a percent of the civilian labor force. So it's very important to realize what they consider unemployed and what they consider the labor force. They consider you unemployed if you don't have a job and you have looked for work in the past four weeks.
Well, let's say, you stop looking for a job for five weeks, because you wanted to take a break and maybe redo your resume for awhile, so you're kind of passively looking for a job. The Government no longer considers you part of the labor force and you're not included in that number.
U-4 is total unemployed. So it's the number up here, plus discouraged workers, as a percent of the civilian labor force, plus discouraged workers. So they're going to add the discouraged workers to the numerator.
U-4 is now-- let me do it in a different color. It is unemployed plus discouraged over employed plus unemployed plus discouraged workers. And their definition of discouraged workers-- I just talked about people who haven't looked or actively
And then U-5 is that same thing, but what they do is they add other marginally attached workers. And the difference between a discouraged worker and a marginally attached worker, a discouraged worker gives the economic reason. They say I haven't looked for a job in the past five weeks because I just think it's impossible.
And then U-6 is really interesting because it includes all of these above but it actually shifts some people.
So in U-5 you would add marginally attached to the denominator there.
In U-6 what you do is you have total unemployed plus all marginally attached workers plus total employed part-time for economic reasons as a percent of the civilian labor force, plus all marginally attached workers. So the important thing here is, plus total employed part-time for economic reasons. That's key, so the denominator doesn't change anymore, but this unemployed number is going to get bigger.
Maybe instead of working as an engineer, they're working 20 hours a week at the local bookstore or at Starbuck's, and these people are included in U-6. And the reason why I want to really highlight that, and Mish pointed this out to me, is that this is increasing much faster than this.
I know this screen right here is really hard to see, but if you look at March 2008, the U-3 number was 5.2% and the
U-6 was 9.3%. So the difference between the two is about 4.1%.
But if you go to the most recent month, the standard unemployment number is 8.5%, but the U-6, the one that includes the discouraged workers, the marginally attached workers and the people who aren't working full time for economic reasons, the difference is now 7.1%, so that spread. People who would like to work, but they've either stopped looking because they've gotten dejected, or they've just bitten the bullet and taken a job that they otherwise wouldn't want to take or taken fewer hours than they otherwise wouldn't want to take, that's growing.
And the reason why we really want to focus on that is because it tells us that even though the unemployment rate, the official unemployment rate-- that is increasing very steeply and I'll show a graph right here, this is actually work Mish did, where he actually shows that the spread between U-6 and U-3 has been increasing, and it's been increasing at an accelerating rate since last February.
That's actually shown right here in this graph. And he got this from his friend Chris Puplava at Financial Sense, so I want to give him credit for it.
So they're either getting depressed or dejected and not looking for work, or they're just saying, you know what? I can't get a job 40 hours a week anymore as an accountant.
This is also from Chris Puplava. If you look relative to the path, the last major recession that a lot of people talk about is the early 80's, the double dip recession, and even though the headline unemployment rate-- let me make sure I get the right color-- the headline unemployment rate here is the blue line, that is still a good bit below. We peaked out there, and I don't know what the exact number is, but it looks like about in the mid 10%.
And that, if you look at least while we have U-6 being measured, it has tracked that broad measure quite well.
So if we can make the assumption that U-6 is always on that line or above it as it's graphed here, which it is so far, then U-6 in the early 80's was probably right around where that line is now.
Maybe it was a little higher, maybe it was up here.
But what this graph really does convey is that that broadest measure of unemployment is already as bad as it probably was in the early 80's. It's just that we don't have that data there. And if anything, those part-time workers, because they are employed, so in the official unemployment measure, they're actually making the number look a little bit better.
And when so much of our economy, and even the basket of goods in the CPl-- and I'll do another video on that --is service based, if you're seeing deflation in wages, that's another data point that tells you, at least in the medium term, we're probably going to see further deflation in prices as a whole. See you in the next video.
Stephanie White: I'm going to let her introduce herself to everybody. Can you tell everybody your name?
Einstein:
Einstein.
SW: This is Einstein. Can you tell everyone "hi"?
E: Hello.
SW: That's nice. Can you be polite?
E: Hi, sweetheart.
SW: Much better. Well, Einstein is very honored to be here at TED 2006, amongst all you modern-day Einsteins.
E: Woo.
SW: Yeah. (Laughter)
E:
[Squawks]
SW: Yeah. (Laughter)
Einstein's especially interested in Penelope's talk. A lot of her research goes on in caves, which can get pretty dusty.
E: Achoo! SW:
Einstein:
[Coughs]
SW: Yeah. (Laughter)
Well, Bob Russell was telling us about his work on nanotubes in his research at the microscopic level. Well, that's really cool, but what Einstein's really hoping is that maybe he'll genetically engineer a five-pound peanut.
E: Oh, my God! My God!
SW: Yeah. She would get really, really excited.
She thinks Burt Rutan is very impressive.
E: Ooh.
SW: Yeah. She especially likes his latest achievement, SpaceShipOne.
Einstein, would you like to ride in Burt's spaceship?
E:
[Spaceship noise]
[Laser noise] (Laughter)
SW: Yeah, yeah. That was pretty funny, Einstein.
E: Wheeeeeee! [Splat]
SW: Yeah. (Laughter)
E: Ow, ow, ow.
SW: Yeah. It's all a lot of hard work.
E:
[Squawks]
SW:
Yeah. It can get a bird like Einstein frustrated.
E:
[Squawks]
SW: Yeah, it sure can. But when Einstein needs to relax from her job educating the public, she loves to take in the arts.
If the children of the Uganda need another dance partner,
Einstein could sure fit the bill, because she loves to dance. Can you get down?
E:
[Bobbing head] (Laughter)
SW: Let's get down for everybody. Come on now.
Einstein: Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
SW: Do your head now.
E: Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. (Laughter)
SW:
Or maybe Sirena Huang would like to learn some arias on her violin, and Einstein can sing along with some opera?
E:
[Operatic squawk]
SW: Very good. (Laughter)
Einstein, can you also sing? I know, you need to get rid of that seed first. Can you sing?
E: La, la.
SW: There you go. And, of course, if all else fails, you can just run off and enjoy a fun fiesta.
E:
[Squawks]
SW: All right. Well, Einstein was pretty embarrassed to admit this earlier, but she was telling me backstage that she had a problem.
E: What's the matter?
SW: No, I don't have a problem. You have the problem, remember?
E: Yar.
SW: There you go. And what do pirates like to drink?
E: Beer.
SW: Yeah, that's right. But you don't like to drink beer, Einstein.
E:
[Water sound]
SW: Very good. Now, really, she is pretty nervous.
She thinks Al Gore is a really good-looking man. What do you say to a good-looking man?
E: Hey, baby. (Laughter)
SW:
And so do all the folks back home in Tennessee.
E: Yee haw. (Laughter)
SW: And since she's such a big fan, she knows that his birthday is coming up at the end of March. And we didn't think he'd be in town then, so Einstein wanted to do something special for him.
So let's see if Einstein will sing "Happy Birthday" to Al Gore. Can you sing "Happy Birthday" to him?
E: Happy birthday to you.
SW: Again.
E: Happy birthday to you.
SW: Again.
E: Happy birthday to you.
SW: Big finish.
E: Happy birthday to you.
SW: Good job! (Applause)
Einstein, do you want to say "hi" to all the owls?
E: Woo, woo, woo. SW:
E: Tweet, tweet, tweet.
SW: And the penguin?
E: Quack, quack, quack.
SW: There we go. (Laughter)
E: Ooh, ooh, ooh. Aah, aah, aah.
SW: Very good. (Laughter)
E: Ooooowww.
SW: And a pig?
E:
Oink, oink, oink.
SW: And the rooster?
E: Cock-a-doodle-doo!
SW: And how about those cats?
E: Meow. (Laughter)
SW: At the zoo we have big cats from the jungle.
E: Grrrrr. (Laughter)
SW: What about a skunk?
E: Stinker. (Laughter)
SW: She's a comedian. I suppose you think you're famous?
E: Superstar.
SW: Yeah. You are a superstar.
Now, Einstein does say it best when we ask her. Why do we want to protect your home?
E: I'm special.
SW: You are very special. What would you like to say to all these nice people?
E: I love you.
SW: That's good. Can you blow them a kiss?
E:
[Kissing noise]
SW: And what do you say when it's time to go?
E: Goodbye.
SW: Good job. Thank you all.
 We're asked to graph the inequality y is less than 3x plus 5. So if you give us any x-- and let me label the axes here.
Now this is our solution. First, Alice and Bob agree publicly on a prime modulus and a generator. In this case, 17 and 3.
So they both calculated 3 raised to the power of their private numbers.
The first well-known cipher - a substitution cipher - was used by Julius Caesar around 58 BC. It is now referred to as the 'Caesar cipher.' Caesar shifted each letter in his military commands in order to make them appear meaningless should the enemy intercept it.
C becomes F - and so on. This unreadable - or 'encrypted' - message is then sent to Bob openly. Then Bob simply subtracts the shift of 3 from each letter, in order to read the original message.
The weakness of the Caesar cipher was published 800 years later by an Arab mathematician named 'Al-Kindi.' He broke the Caesar cipher by using a clue based on an important property of the language a message is written in. If you scan text from any book, and count the frequency of each letter, you will find a fairly consistent pattern.
So they reverse the shift in order to reveal the original message. This is called 'frequency analysis.'
Zach: My name is Zach Kaplan.
I'm the CEO of Inventables, the online hardware store for designers. I love building things. Originally we had a business, servicing R and D and design people at big companies.
Companies like Black and Decker and Nike. Then, a couple years ago, the cost of making stuff, the cost of machinery, all started dropping. Then websites came out like Etsy and Kickstarter.
We launched this hardware store, to make that research that we were doing for big companies, available to everyone. The world started paying attention in a big way, to digital manufacturing and desktop fabrication. Because the cost of entry, just like what happened with desktop publishing in the 80's, all of a sudden dropped down to a couple hundred bucks to play.
I hope that when we look back, we'll see that Inventables helped ignite, the digital fabrication revolution. I believe that that will build a new generation of entrepreneurs, who can be their own boss and get to love making stuff every day.
We have 7329 - 6278. So let's go place by place, and see if we can subtract. 6278 is clearly less than 7329, so we should be able to do this.
 Simplify the expression 28a to the fourth, b to the sixth, over 7a to the ninth b. So a good place to start here is to just try to kind of break this up into things that we can simplify a lot easier.
Times b. 6 minus-- you have a 1 here. You don't see the 1, but it's there.
I've got five numbers here and the goal is to order them from least to greatest. And it might be obvious to you that all five of these numbers are negative numbers. So let's just think about which of these is the greatest number.
Consider the following: Alice and Bob have figured out how to transmit messages between their treehouses. At first, they used flames at night, and shutters during the day.
The problem is in order to pay for their equipment, they needed money. So they decided to offer their service - for a fee to others.
And on the first day, Alice had three new customers who wanted to transmit messages to their friends over at Bob's treehouse. The first customer wanted to send a list of 10 coin flips. The second customer wanted to send a 6-letter word.
The question now is, "How much should she charge?" Well, the price of a message should depend on how long it takes Alice to transmit it. But how could she measure the length of different types of messages using a common unit?
One questions - such as, "Is it heads?" - will suffice. For 10 flips, what is the minimum number of questions? Well, 10 flips times one question per flip equals 10 questions - or 10 binary digits to transmit this message.
If we receive a 1 - yes - we cut out half of the possibilities - [so we have] 13 left. And since we can't split a letter in half, we divide the possible symbols into sets of 6 and 7, and ask is it less than G?
We receive a 1, which is yes. And now we are left with 6 possible letters. And we can split them in half, and ask,
We receive a 0, which is no - leaving us with three possible letters. And now we can pick a side and ask, "Is it D?"
We receive a no. And after five questions, we have correctly identified the symbol: F.
But we can save time and just use our equation. Log, base 2, of 52 is approximately 5.7, since 2 to the power of 5.7 is approximately 52. So the minimum number of questions, on average, is 5.7 per card.
Ralph Hartley was a prolific electronics researcher, who built on the ideas of Harry Nyquist - both of whom worked at Bell Labs after World War I. And in 1928, Hartley published an important paper titled "The Transmission of Information."
And in it, he defines the word 'information' using the symbol h - as: h = n × logarithm of s, where h is our information, n is the number of symbols - whether they're notes, letters, numbers, etc. - and s is the number of different symbols available at each selection.
And this can also be written as h = logarithm of s^n.
And Hartley writes, "What we have done, then, is to take, as our practical measure of information, the logarithm of the number of possible symbol sequences. So, information is the logarithm of the message space.
Because when we can predict things in advance, we shouldn't need to ask as many yes-or-no questions to define it. But how could we formally model this subtle difference? This question brings us to the key insight in our story.
Despite the fact that a highly effective influenza vaccine is available every year, some people choose not to get vaccinated and as a result they're not protected against the circulating influenza strains.
"Well, imagine if a completely inactivated, or weakened virus in the influenza vaccine was enough to get your immune system to put up a fight and make you feel sick, imagine what a live strong virus could do to you. Getting sick with the circulating virus will make you feel much worse, and so it's best to prevent yourself from getting a bad illness. Another excuse you might here is, "The flu shot didn't work.
Flu-like symptoms can be caused by tons of different kinds of viruses and a few bacterial species as well.
The influenza vaccine is not a magic bullet. It doesn't prevent all kinds of infections from happening. But perhaps you were infected with an influenza virus that got you sick.
Remember the influenza vaccine only protects against a few strains, the most common strains that will be circulating in that season. So it's possible that you got sick with another circulating strain that wasn't covered by the vaccine.
So, with this information some people might say, "Wait a minute, if I can still get sick from the influenza virus then what's the point?" Like I said, the annual vaccine protects against the most common influenza strains for that particular season.
So it reduces your chance of getting sick significantly. Does it eliminate the risk completely? Well, no, but that doesn't mean that it's not worthwhile.
I believe that there are new, hidden tensions that are actually happening between people and institutions -- institutions that are the institutions that people inhabit in their daily life: schools, hospitals, workplaces, factories, offices, etc. And something that I see happening is something that I would like to call a sort of "democratization of intimacy." And what do I mean by that?
Facebook is the channel that you would expect is the most enlargening of all channels.
And an average user, said Cameron Marlow, from Facebook, has about 120 friends.
But he actually talks to, has two-way exchanges with, about four to six people on a regular base, depending on his gender. Academic research on instant messaging also shows 100 people on buddy lists, but fundamentally people chat with two, three, four -- anyway, less than five. My own research on cellphones and voice calls shows that 80 percent of the calls are actually made to four people.
But Danny Miller, who is a very good anthropologist who is working on Filipina migrant women who leave their children back in the Philippines, was telling me about how much parenting is going on through Skype, and how much these mothers are engaged with their children through Skype. And then there is the third couple. They are two friends.
like a $15 fine to kids in Texas, for using, every time they take out their mobile phone in school.
Immediate dismissal to bus drivers in New York, if seen with a mobile phone in a hand. Companies blocking access to IM or to Facebook. Behind issues of security and safety, which have always been the arguments for social control, in fact what is going on is that these institutions are trying to decide who, in fact, has a right to self determine their attention, to decide, whether they should, or not, be isolated.
We're asked to find the area of the shaded region, so the area of this red-shaded region. So this is interesting. This is almost a 10 by 10 square, except we have these quarter circles that are cut out.
I am 10 years old. This is the audition day to enter the Scala Dance School of Milan. I am walking up the steps of a huge stairway which takes me to the exam room.
They tell me, "Here, come in." This is a huge room with huge mirrors. And I realize that we are some 20 little girls, all rather terrified by this austere place.
The ladies tell us, "Now you can dance your own way, barefoot." Luckily enough I think, because at that moment,
And as I am dancing, I remember the comforting words from my professor, my maestro, Maestro Morucci when he used to say, "Listen, there are two important things: technique and passion. One day, they will come together as one." "You have passion, it is your treasure."
Then one of the ladies, still holding the same smile of course, tells us, "Now, we have made our decision: here on the right side, are the pupils we selected to enter the Scala, and on the left, the ones that we, unfortunately, cannot take on. You may leave." I am on the left.
I still manage to get down the stairs and get to the place my mother has been waiting for me on the first floor, and I tell her in a tired voice, "Mommy, I was turned down." Suddenly, in a snap, my life, my beautiful world of a little girl destined to be a dancer falls apart. From good pupil, I turn into someone bad, a monster with ugly feet.
The pain kept coming back, every time, as if I had forgotten the meaning of the word "happiness", as if I had lost the right to be happy. Fortunately, time heals all wounds. One day, I set myself free from this failure circle, and I realized there were 1,000 ways to dance life.
I first made post-graduate studies, and I wrote a thesis called "Educating to Joy". What does "Educating to Joy" mean? I first discovered that joy is my passion today.
And you wouldn't believe it, but I discovered that the word "joy", its etymology in Sanskrit is "Yuj".
This means the link, it is a connection, a relation. It's beautiful! But what does being linked mean?
After all, it is remembering Maria Montessori's words when she said, "Joy of learning is as essential as intelligence, as breathing is to runners and dancers!" (Applause)
What is the area of this figure? And this figure right over here is sometimes called a kite for obvious reasons. If you tied some string here, you might want to fly it at the beach.
5,524 plus 0. Well, I'm adding 0. I'm adding nothing, so it's still just going to be 5,524.
[Thrun] Here's another quiz. What's the probability that the coin comes up heads, heads, heads, three times in a row, assuming that each one of those has a probability of a half and that these coin flips are independent?
Regina rode her bike 2 and 1/4 miles from her house to school and then 1 and 5/8 miles to her friend's house. How many miles did Regina ride in total? So she first rode 2 and 1/4 miles, and then she rode 1 and 5/8 miles. then she rode 1 and 5/8 miles
8 goes into 9 one time with 1 left over, so it's 1 and 1/8. So this is the same thing as 3 plus 1 and 1/8. So now we can add the whole number parts.
[Male narrator] --a favorite, a robotic car. I wish to know whether it is partially observable, stochastic, continuous, or adversarial. That is, is the problem of driving robotically-- say, in a city--subject to any of those 4 categories?
So for any of us in this room today, let's start out by admitting we're lucky. We don't live in the world our mothers lived in, our grandmothers lived in, where career choices for women were so limited. And if you're in this room today, most of us grew up in a world where we have basic civil rights, and amazingly, we still live in a world where some women don't have them.
"Yeah. Or maybe you're the only one who had to go to the bathroom." (Laughter)
In the high-income part of our workforce, in the people who end up at the top -- Fortune 500 CEO jobs, or the equivalent in other industries -- the problem, I am convinced, is that women are dropping out. Now people talk about this a lot, and they talk about things like flextime and mentoring and programs companies should have to train women.
And my brother says, "I got the top grade in the class."
(Laughter) "You got the top grade in the class? You don't know anything."
If you test men and women, and you ask them questions on totally objective criteria like GPAs, men get it wrong slightly high, and women get it wrong slightly low. Women do not negotiate for themselves in the workforce. A study in the last two years of people entering the workforce out of college showed that 57 percent of boys entering, or men, I guess, are negotiating their first salary, and only seven percent of women.
I wish I could go tell all the young women I work for, these fabulous women, "Believe in yourself and negotiate for yourself. Own your own success."
And she starts thinking about having a child, and from the moment she starts thinking about having a child, she starts thinking about making room for that child. "How am I going to fit this into everything else I'm doing?" And literally from that moment, she doesn't raise her hand anymore, she doesn't look for a promotion, she doesn't take on the new project, she doesn't say, "Me.
I want to do that." She starts leaning back. The problem is that --
We're asked to solve for x. And we have 9x squared minus 42x, plus 29 is equal to negative 20. Now, you might be tempted immediately to try to factor the left-hand side of this equation to get the product of two binomials, and that they equal negative 20.
And 49 is 7 squared, or negative 7 squared.
And let's see, negative 42-- 3 times 7 is 21. 21 times 2 is positive 42.
But if we make this a negative 7, because negative 7 would also work, negative 7 squared is also 49. Then 3 times negative 7, times 2 is negative 42. Let me write that down.
We finished the last video with the Reign of Terror - which lasted essentially from April of 1793 to July of 1794 - where Robespierre himself got the losing end of the guillotine. So it looks like France was done with the low point of the Revolution. And that is true - especially from the point of view of the French people.
I have a daughter, Mulan. And when she was eight, last year, she was doing a report for school or she had some homework about frogs. And we were at this restaurant, and she said, "So, basically, frogs lay eggs and the eggs turn into tadpoles, and tadpoles turn into frogs."
And she says, "What? Only the females have eggs?" And I said, "Yeah."
So I kind of said, "Oh, it's this extra ingredient, you know, that you need to create a new frog from the mom and dad frog." (Laughter) And she said, "Oh, so is that true for humans too?" And I thought, "Okay, here we go."
"Only answer the question they're asking. Don't give any more information." (Laughter) So I said, "Yes."
We have evolved to have our own pond. We have our very own pond inside our bodies. And we lay our eggs there, we don't have to worry about other eggs or anything like that.
And so we're just eating, and her jaw just drops, and she goes, "Mom! Like, where you go to the bathroom?" And I said, "I know.
Mom, does the man just say, 'Is now the time to take off my pants?'" (Laughter) And I said, "Yes."
"That is exactly right. That's exactly how it happens." So we're driving home and she's looking out the window, and she goes,
And then she goes, "What if there was like a party, and there was just like a whole bunch of girls and a whole bunch of boys, and there was a bunch of men and women and they just started doing it, Mom? Would that ever happen?" And I said, "Oh, no, no.
"Mom, how do cats do it?" And I go, "Oh, it's the same. It's basically the same."
And then she got all caught up in the legs. "But how would the legs go, Mom? I don't understand the legs."
So I go, "You know, why don't we go on the Internet, and maybe we can see ... like on Wikipedia." (Laughter) So we go online, and we put in "cats mating."
And, unfortunately, on YouTube, there's many cats mating videos. And we watched them and I'm so thankful, because she's just like, "Wow!
This is so amazing." She goes, "What about dogs?" So we put in dogs mating, and, you know, we're watching it, and she's totally absorbed.
Let's do some solid geometry and volume problems. so they tell us shown is a triangular prism. and so there's a couple of types of three dimensional figures that deal with triangles. And this is what a triangular prism looks like it has a triangle on one two faces and they are kind of separated, they kind of have rectangles in between. the other kind of triangular three dimensional figures as you might see would be pyramids this is a rectangular pyramid, cuz it has a rectangular, or it has a square base, just like that you could also have a triangular pyramid where literally every side is a triangle. but this over here is a triangular prism. I don't want to get to much into the shape classification. if the base of the triangle b is equal to 7 the height of the triangle 'h' is equal to 3 and the lenght of the prism 'l' is equal to 4 what is the total volume of the prism? so they are saying that the base is equal to seven so this right over here is equal to base is equal to seven the height of the triangle is equal to 3 so this right over here this distance right over here
'h' is equal to 3 and the length of the prism is equal to 4 so i'm assuming it is this dimension right over here is equal to 4 so length is equal to four so in this situation what you really just have to do is figure out the area of this triangle right over here we could figure out the area of this triangle and multiply it by how much you go deep so multiply it by this length so the volume is going to be the area of this triangle let me do it in pink the area of this triangle we know that the area of a triangle is one half, times the base, times the height so the area this area right over here is going to be one half times the base times the height and we are going to multiply it by like kind of our depth of our triangular prism so we have a depth of four so we are going to multiply that times the four times this depth times the four and we get, let's see one half times four is two so these guys cancel out, you'll just have a two and then 2 times 3 is 6 6 times 7 is forty... is forty two and it would be in some kind of cubic unit so if these were in i don't know centimeters, it would be centimeters cubed but they are not making us focus on units in this problem let's do another one shown is a cube if each side is of equal length 'x' is equal to 3 what is the total volume of the cube? so each side is equal length x which happens to equal to 3 so this side is 3 this side over here x is equal to 3 every side x is equal to 3 so it's actually the same exercise as the triangular prism it is actually a bit easier when you are doing it with a cube where you really just want to find the area of this surface right over here now this is pretty straight forward this is just a square it would be the base times the height or since they are the same it is just 3 times 3 so the volume is going to be the area of this surface 3 times 3 times the depth times the depth so we go 3 deep so times so times three and so we get 3 times 3 times 3 so this is 27 or you might recognize this from exponents this is the same thing as three to the third power and that is why sometimes if you have something to the third power they'll say you cubed it because literally to find the volume of a cube you take the length of one side and you multiply that number by itself three times one for each dimension one for the length, the width, and or I guess the height, the length and the depth. depending on how you want to define them. so it's literally just 3 times 3 times 3
My big idea is a very, very small idea that can unlock billions of big ideas that are at the moment dormant inside us. And my little idea that will do that is sleep. (Laughter) (Applause)
So a high I.Q. does not mean that you're a good leader, because the essence of leadership is being able to see the iceberg before it hits the Titanic. And we've had far too many icebergs hitting our Titanics.
In fact, I have a feeling that if Lehman Brothers was Lehman Brothers and Sisters, they might still be around.
(Applause) While all the brothers were busy just being hyper-connected 24/7, maybe a sister would have noticed the iceberg, because she would have woken up from a seven-and-a-half- or eight-hour sleep and have been able to see the big picture. So as we are facing all the multiple crises in our world at the moment, what is good for us on a personal level, what's going to bring more joy, gratitude, effectiveness in our lives and be the best for our own careers is also what is best for the world.
In the following polynomial, identify the terms along with the coefficient and exponent of each term. So the terms are the things being added up in this polynomial. So the terms here, let me write the terms here...
-8x, so -8x is the second term, and the third term here is the 7, it's called the polynomial poly, it has many terms, or you could view each term as a monomial, it's a polynomial with only one term in it.
So those are the terms, now lets think about the coefficient of each of the terms. The coefficient is what's multiplying the power of x, or what's multiplying the x part of the term, so over here, the x part is x squared, that's being multiplied by three, so three is the coefficient on the first term. On the second term, we have -8 multiplying x, and we want to be clear-- the coefficient isn't just 8, it's -8, it's -8 that's multiplying x, so that's the coefficient right over here
To most of you, this is a device to buy, sell, play games, watch videos. I think it might be a lifeline. I think actually it might be able to save more lives than penicillin.
I know I say texting and a lot of you think sexting, a lot of you think about the lewd photos that you see -- hopefully not your kids sending to somebody else -- or trying to translate the abbreviations LOL, LMAO, HMU. I can help you with those later.
"I don't want to go to school today.
The boys call me faggot."
"I was cutting, my parents found out, and so I stopped. But I just started again an hour ago." Or, "He won't stop raping me.
There's something in New York City. The police did it. It used to be just guess work, police work.
"You're having a problem every Thursday at three o'clock. What's going on in your school?" You could see the immediate impact of legislation or a hateful speech that somebody gives in a school assembly and see what happens as a result.
Because while people are talking about data, making it possible for Facebook to mine my friend from the third grade, or Target to know when it's time for me to buy more diapers, or some dude to build a better baseball team, I'm actually really excited about the power of data and the power of texting to help that kid go to school, to help that girl stop cutting in the bathroom and absolutely to help that girl whose father's raping her. Thank you.
Entering into World War 1, the British had the world's dominant navy. And they used it immediately to their advantage. You might remember from previous videos
which essentially is telling any ship: 'come here at your own risk.' 'you might be destroyed.' And especially 'you are not allowed...' ...'to carry any contraband.' But they included food as a contraband
We are talking about 1,000 calories a day; you can look at the number of calories in your Big Mac and think about how little food that was. and there's many estimates of what that caused. It obviously made it very hard for the Central Powers to get munitions and things like that but it also made it very difficult for them to get food. And there are estimates that this rationing, this inability to get food,
similarily they declared that... a war zone... as well. And because their surface fleet was concentrated right over here, the way that they would enforce that, that they would try to keep people from trading with the British Isles is through submarine warfare. And World War 1 is the first time that submarine warfare becomes a significant factor.
In May of 1915, you have the passenger liner R.M.S. Lusitania.
R.M.S. stands for Royal Mail Ship, because it carried some mail. It is a big ship. If you've ever seen the movie 'Titanic', think of a ship like that.
the German embassy actually placed an advertisement - and this is worth reading - they wrote: "NOTlCE!"...
Whenever we talk about money, the amount of money is not the only thing that matters.
Let's call that X. Whatever amount of money that is, times, if I grow it by 10%, that's literally, I'm taking X+10%X+ ...
X+10%X should be equal to our $65. If I take the amount I get 10% of that amount over the year, that should be equal to $65. This is the same thing as 1X or we can say that 1X+10% is the same thing as 0.10X is equal to 65, or you add these 2.
We're asked to subtract and simplify the answer, and we have 8/18 minus 5/18. So subtracting fractions is very similar to adding fractions. If we have the same denominator, the denominator in the difference is going to be the same as the denominators in the two numbers that we're subtracting, so it's going to be 18.
I have spent my entire life either at the schoolhouse, on the way to the schoolhouse, or talking about what happens in the schoolhouse. (Laughter) Both my parents were educators, my maternal grandparents were educators, and for the past 40 years, I've done the same thing.
James Comer says that no significant learning can occur without a significant relationship.
George Washington Carver says all learning is understanding relationships. Everyone in this room has been affected by a teacher or an adult. For years, I have watched people teach.
"They don't pay me to like the kids. They pay me to teach a lesson. The kids should learn it.
"You know, kids don't learn from people they don't like." (Laughter) (Applause) She said, "That's just a bunch of hooey."
"Well, your year is going to be long and arduous, dear." Needless to say, it was. Some people think that you can either have it in you to build a relationship, or you don't.
I think Stephen Covey had the right idea. He said you ought to just throw in a few simple things, like seeking first to understand, as opposed to being understood.
They said, "That's okay, Ms. Pierson. You were so excited, we just let you go."
I have had classes that were so low, so academically deficient, that I cried. I wondered, "How am I going to take this group, in nine months, from where they are to where they need to be? And it was difficult, it was awfully hard.
"You were chosen to be in my class because I am the best teacher and you are the best students, they put us all together so we could show everybody else how to do it." One of the students said, "Really?" (Laughter)
"I am somebody. I was somebody when I came. I'll be a better somebody when I leave.
He said, "Ms. Pierson, is this an F?" I said, "Yes." (Laughter)
You see, "-18" sucks all the life out of you. "+2" said, "I ain't all bad."
For years, I watched my mother take the time at recess to review, go on home visits in the afternoon, buy combs and brushes and peanut butter and crackers to put in her desk drawer for kids that needed to eat, and a washcloth and some soap for the kids who didn't smell so good. See, it's hard to teach kids who stink. (Laughter)
So teachers become great actors and great actresses, and we come to work when we don't feel like it, and we're listening to policy that doesn't make sense, and we teach anyway. We teach anyway, because that's what we do. Teaching and learning should bring joy.
We're now ready to talk about one of the most famous events in all of world history that really was the trigger for World War 1 or the Great War as it was called back then. So this is a little bit of backdrop. In 1908, the austro-hungarian empire formally annexes
One of my favorite cartoon characters is Snoopy. I love the way he sits and lies on his kennel and contemplates the great things of life. So when I thought about compassion, my mind immediately went to one of the cartoon strips, where he's lying there and he says,
So that is the way I feel: that I can only try to approach this notion of being compassionate, of understanding that there is a connectivity, that there is a unity in this world; that I want to try and serve that unity, and that I can try and do that by understanding, I hope, trying to understand something of the pain of others; but understanding that there are limits, that people have to bear responsibility for some of the problems that come upon them; and that I have to understand that there are limits to my energy, to the giving I can give. I have to reevaluate them, try and separate out the material things and my emotions that may be enslaving me, so that I can see the world clearly. And then I have to try to see in what ways
 For an art project, a pentagon made of construction paper is cut into five equal slices. Two of the slices are removed.
Organic chemists make molecules, very complicated molecules, by chopping up a big molecule into small molecules and reverse engineering. And as a chemist, one of the things I wanted to ask my research group a couple of years ago is, could we make a really cool universal chemistry set? In essence, could we "app" chemistry?
Beam me up, Scotty. (Applause)
So one of the main purposes of accounting for anything of making these accounting statements in the first place is so that you can reflect what's going on in a buisness and that might be for investors, to see how a buisness is doing, or it might be for the managers of a buisness So they can see where the buisness is doing well, where it's not doing well, or maybe how rescorces should be allocated So let's se which of these two methods of accouting, the cash method and the accrual method
Cash is a asset because you can use it to buy stuff and get people to do stuff for you To get some future benefit. So both cash and Accounts Receivables are assets.
A carpenter is using a lathe to shape the final leg of a hand-crafted table. A lathe is this carpentry tool that spins things around, and so it can be used to make things that are, I guess you could say, almost cylindrical in shape, like a leg for a table or something like that. In order for the leg to fit, it needs to be 150 millimeters wide, allowing for a margin of error of 2.5 millimeters.
I am a writer. Writing books is my profession but it's more than that, of course. It is also my great lifelong love and fascination.
And the peculiar thing is that I recently wrote this book, this memoir called "Eat, Pray, Love" which, decidedly unlike any of my previous books, went out in the world for some reason, and became this big, mega-sensation, international bestseller thing.
"Aren't you afraid you're never going to be able to top that? Aren't you afraid you're going to keep writing for your whole life and you're never again going to create a book that anybody in the world cares about at all, ever again?" So that's reassuring, you know.
"That chemical-engineering block, John, how's it going?" It just didn't come up like that, you know? But to be fair, chemical engineers as a group haven't really earned a reputation over the centuries for being alcoholic manic-depressives.
Norman Mailer, just before he died, last interview, he said,
"Every one of my books has killed me a little more." An extraordinary statement to make about your life's work. But we don't even blink when we hear somebody say this, because we've heard that kind of stuff for so long and somehow we've completely internalized and accepted collectively this notion that creativity and suffering are somehow inherently linked and that artistry, in the end, will always ultimately lead to anguish.
And then the Renaissance came and everything changed, and we had this big idea, and the big idea was, let's put the individual human being at the center of the universe above all gods and mysteries, and there's no more room for mystical creatures who take dictation from the divine. And it's the beginning of rational humanism, and people started to believe that creativity came completely from the self of the individual.
And for me, the best contemporary example that I have of how to do that is the musician Tom Waits, who I got to interview several years ago on a magazine assignment. And we were talking about this, and you know, Tom, for most of his life, he was pretty much the embodiment of the tormented contemporary modern artist, trying to control and manage and dominate these sort of uncontrollable creative impulses that were totally internalized. But then he got older, he got calmer, and one day he was driving down the freeway in Los Angeles, and this is when it all changed for him.
like, "I'm going to lose this thing, and I'll be be haunted by this song forever. I'm not good enough, and I can't do it." And instead of panicking, he just stopped.
"Excuse me, can you not see that I'm driving?" (Laughter)
"Do I look like I can write down a song right now? If you really want to exist, come back at a more opportune moment when I can take care of you. Otherwise, go bother somebody else today.
Go bother Leonard Cohen." And his whole work process changed after that. Not the work, the work was still oftentimes as dark as ever.
It could be this peculiar, wondrous, bizarre collaboration, kind of conversation between Tom and the strange, external thing that was not quite Tom. When I heard that story, it started to shift a little bit the way that I worked too, and this idea already saved me once. It saved me when I was in the middle of writing "Eat, Pray, Love," and I fell into one of those sort of pits of despair that we all fall into when we're working on something and it's not coming and you start to think this is going to be a disaster, the worst book ever written.
"Allah, Allah, Allah, God, God, God." That's God, you know.
Curious historical footnote: when the Moors invaded southern Spain, they took this custom with them and the pronunciation changed over the centuries from "Allah, Allah, Allah," to "Olé, olé, olé," which you still hear in bullfights and in flamenco dances.
"Allah, olé, olé, Allah, magnificent, bravo," incomprehensible, there it is -- a glimpse of God. Which is great, because we need that. But, the tricky bit comes the next morning, for the dancer himself, when he wakes up and discovers that it's Tuesday at 11 a.m., and he's no longer a glimpse of God.
June Cohen:
Olé! (Applause)
The graph of the line 2y+3x=7 is given right over here determine its x-intercept. So the x-intercept is the x value when y is equal to 0 or is the x value where our graph actually intercepts the x axis. Notice right over here our y value is exactly 0, where sitting on the x axis.
It's between 2 and 3, it looks like its less than 2 and a half, but we donpt know the exact value so lets got turn to the equation to figure out the exact value. So we esentially have to figure out what x value when y is equal to 0 will have this equation be true. So we could just say 2(0)+3x=7.
Which of the following numbers is a factor of 154? So when a number is going to be a factor of 154 is if we can divide that number into 154 and not have a remainder. Or another way of thinking about it-- a number is a factor of 154 if 154 is a multiple of that number.
Right now, standing on this stage, by speaking these words, I'm changing your brain. And I know, it sounds like a superpower (Laughter) but you have it, too, you're changing my brain just by being here.
Today we're all gathered to bask in the warm glow of TED. Unfortunately, our bodies, your bodies, will spend most of this time just sitting, and that's a problem because as you might have heard sitting is the smoking of our generation. (Laughter)
- can you see it? - put it in a pill and then sell it to you, they would do it in a heartbeat. And then, they would finally have a blockbuster drug completely free of any difficult side effects like weight loss or weight gain, sedation, emotional blunting, loss of libido.
with all this medication, with this huge increase, why is it that there's been no corresponding decrease in the rate of depression in the last 20 years? Have you ever wondered about that? How do we still have an epidemic of this illness?
 Find the volume of a cube with a side length of 8xy squared. So we have a cube right here.
So this is the same thing as 8 to the third power times x to the third power times y squared to the third power. And what's 8 to the third power?
8 squared is 64, so we'll multiply 64 times 8. 4 times 8 is 32. 6 times 8 is 48 plus 3 is 51.
So this is equal to 512 times x to the third and y squared to the third power, that's the same thing is y to the 2 times 3 power, or y to the sixth power. And we're done. We found the volume of the cube.
It's 512 x to the third y to the sixth.
We've been talking a lot about elasticities of a demand, so you were probably wondering, can we think about elasticities of a supply? And as you can imagine, the answer is: of course we can! And it's interesting to think about how does the quantity the percent change in quantity supplied relate to percent change in prices
f of x is equal to 7x minus 5 g of x is equal to x to the third power plus 4x and then they ask us to find f times g of x so the first thing to realize is that this notation, f times g of x, is just referring to a function that is the product of f of x and g of x so by definition, this notation just means f of x times g of x and then we just have to substitute f of x with this definition and g of x with this definition and then multiply out these algebraic expressions so f of x is right over there and g of x is right over there so lets do it so this is going to be equal to, switch back to the orange color, is going to be equal to f of x which is 7x minus five times g of x and g of x is x to the third power plus 4x and you could, if we were multiplying two expressions that each have two terms, you could use FOlL if you like i don't like using FOlL becuase you might forget what it's even about FOlL is really just using the distributive property twice so, for example, you take this expression, whatever you have out here if you had a 9 out here or an "a" or an "x" or anything, now you have 7x minus 5 if your multipling it times this expression you would multiply this times each term over here so when you multuply 7x minus 5 times x to the third you get, and i'll write it this way, you get x to the third times, acutally let me write it the other way you get 7x minus five times x to the third and then you have plus 7x minus 5 times 4x and now we can do the distributive property again we're not normally used to seeing the things we distributed on the right hand side but it's the same exact idea. we could put x to the third here as well now when we distribute, you multiply x to the third times 7x and times negative 5 x to the third times 7x is 7x to the fourth power x to the third times negative 5 is minus 5x to the third and then you do it over here, you distribute the 4x times 7x is plus 28x squared 4x times negative 5 is minus 20x and lets see if we can simplify this we only have one fourth degree term, one third degree term, one second degree term, and one first degree term so actually you can't simplify this anymore and we're done! this is the product of those two function definitions this is f times g of x. it is a new function created by multiplying the other two functions.
At the beginning of the week,
Stewart's checking account had a balance of negative fifteen dollars and eight cents. On Monday morning he deposited a check for four hundred twenty-six dollars and ninety cents. On Tuesday morning he deposited another check for [one] hundred dollars.
He started, owing fifteen dollars and eight cents, and then he's going to add five hundred twenty-six dollars and ninety cents. So, one way to visualize it, is if you think about it on the number line, and this is zero right over here. He starts off at negative fifteen-point-zero-eight, but then he's going to add five hundred and twenty-six dollars [and ninety cents].
Today I have two parts. Part 1, I perform two performances. For the first performance I use this big screen.
(Audience) OK. Thank you. (Applause)
The "DOT" image is a video game.
"DOT" was named after the 8-bit dot, OK?
Please enjoy "DOT". (Applause)
(Music)
[ DOT.]
[END]
(Applause)
I am tired. (Laughter)
"DOT" was on a big screen. The next magic is on a small type screen,
iPad. (Audience) Wow. This magic has a theme;
"TSUTAWARU" communication.
Throughout history, we have been constantly inventing the way of communication. The history of humanity is the history of communication. The first communication way to long distance is the smoke signal.
(Audience) Wow.
(Audience) Wow!
(Applause) After that we developed photography. Today we have lots of ways of communication.
[Money]
It's me. Women and money. And you can try like this.
Oh it's great. (Audience) Wow. (Applause)
Today I will talk about the story of "iPad magic". Since "iPad magic" was uploaded on YouTube in 2010, my life was changed. I will talk about " How to become a hero on the web".
We often hear stories about someone's life changed overnight due to a movie uploaded on YouTube, watched by millions of people. We all stand a good chance to become a hero like this cat. (Laughter)
And I got interviewed by over 150 medias including CNN and The Wall Street Journal. And I have had the honor to perform it in front of celebrities.
In December 2009, I was deeply moved by the performance of 'Cirque Du Soleil'.
At the same time, I was frustrated since I did not create such a great show. One month later, on January 1st, 2010, I decided to produce contents which can inspire people around the world.
I used Google Trend service, which shows the "Wave" of Trend. It's Google Trend. Here, this graph shows the volume of keywords
I tried to catch the new " Wave of trend " coming up in 2010.
An idea flashed on my mind that the new " Wave of trend " will be made by iPad in 2010. As a result, in 2010, the total hit of iPad was 4 times as much as Olympic Games. When you focus on 2010, you can see three peaks.
For example, when Ichiro, a famous baseball player achieved 200 hits for 10 consecutive seasons, people talked about him a lot, and wanted to say how great Ichiro is like this. On May 28th 2010, the day of iPad launched, I thought that people wanted to talk about " iPad " and say how marvelous it was, just like Ichiro's case.
In the last video we saw that if Ben's shoe company's stock prices are trading at $21.50 per share and if Ben's shoe company has 10,000 shares, and we saw that over here on the left....
If it had 10,000 shares, and actually both of the shoe companies had 10,000 shares, then the market is essentially valuing the equity of Ben's shoe company at $215,000, even though the book value of the equity was $135,000. What I want to do in this video is think about what does that mean, or how should we perceive the market's value of the assets of Ben's shoe company, and then we can also think about Jason's shoe company. So, remember, assets are equal to liabilites plus shareholder's equity, so if all of a sudden the market value of the equity, the market capitalization, for Ben's shoe company is $215,000... (That is the equity part right over here)
Ben has actually done a good job of saying the market value of his inventory, the market value of his equipment. Well, what the market is saying in this situation, and this is actually what tends to happen where the market value or in general the market value of a company tends to be higher than the book value, is that the company is saying that this company has some type of intangibles, things that you really can't put a finger on, or touch or feel or hold. But it makes this company's assets, or this company has more than just the sum of its parts.
And the same thing is true of Jason's company. When they assign a $120,000 market cap there... This is $120,000 in equity, market value of equity, he has another $105,000 in liabilites.
120 + 100 + 5 So 225,000 So once again they're valuing all of the assets at 225,000.
As we get into the second half of the 1930s, we see an increasingly aggressive Nazi Germany. In 1935, they publicly announce their intent to rearm their military. The reason why this is significant is not that they were all of a sudden building their military.
'the straw that broke the camel's back,' and is the beginning of -- So, Poland invasion.
The invasion of Poland. -- which is the beginning of World War Il.
Now that we know a little bit about Newton's First Law. Let's give ourselves a little quiz.
So let's think about these statement by statement. Our first statement right over here "If the net force on a body is zero, its velocity will not change." This is absolutely true.
That is what slowing it down. So in our everyday life, the reason why we don't see these things go on forever is that we have these frictions, these air resistance or the friction with actual surfaces. And then the last statement.
Imagine, if you will -- a gift. I'd like for you to picture it in your mind. It's not too big -- about the size of a golf ball.
"You look great. Have you had any work done?" And you'll have a lifetime supply of good drugs.
Does Amazon carry it? Does it have the Apple logo on it? Is there a waiting list?
Well, that's kind of an obvious statement up there. I started with that sentence about 12 years ago, and I started in the context of developing countries, but you're sitting here from every corner of the world. So if you think of a map of your country,
"These are places where good teachers won't go." On top of that, those are the places from where trouble comes. So we have an ironic problem -- good teachers don't want to go to just those places where they're needed the most.
Make yourself understood to the computer." So the children said, "How do we do that." And I said,
"I don't know, actually." (Laughter) And I left.
"A teacher that can be replaced by a machine should be." (Laughter) The second thing he said was that,
"If children have interest, then education happens." And I was doing that in the field, so every time I would watch it and think of him. (Video) Arthur C. Clarke:
They said, "There's no way you're going to handle a million pounds-worth of University money sitting in Delhi." So in 2006, I bought myself a heavy overcoat and moved to Newcastle.
"Did you understand anything?" "No, nothing." So I said,
"Well, how long did you practice on it before you decided you understood nothing?" They said, "We look at it every day." So I said, "For two months, you were looking at stuff you didn't understand?"
"Apart from the fact that improper replication of the DNA molecule causes genetic disease, we've understood nothing else." (Laughter) (Applause) (Laughter) It took me three years to publish that.
"It's too good to be true," which was not very nice. Well, one of the girls had taught herself to become the teacher. And then that's her over there.
Remember, they don't study English.
I edited out the last bit when I asked, "Where is the neuron?" and she says, "The neuron? The neuron," and then she looked and did this. Whatever the expression, it was not very nice.
"You can exchange groups. You can walk across to another group, if you don't like your group, etc. You can go to another group, peer over their shoulders, see what they're doing, come back to you own group and claim it as your own work."
"Now, what do you want us to do?" I gave them six GCSE questions. The first group -- the best one -- solved everything in 20 minutes.
So they did that, and over the last two years, over 600 hours of instruction has happened over Skype, using what my students call the granny cloud. The granny cloud sits over there. I can beam them to whichever school I want to.
(Video) Teacher: You can't catch me. You say it.
SM: Back at Gateshead, a 10-year-old girl gets into the heart of Hinduism in 15 minutes. You know, stuff which I don't know anything about.
After watching eight TEDTalks, he wants to become Leonardo da Vinci. (Laughter) (Applause) It's pretty simple stuff.
next question: where is Calcutta? This one, they took only 10 minutes.
I tried a really hard one then. Who was Pythagoras, and what did he do? There was silence for a while, then they said, "You've spelled it wrong.
And then, in 20 minutes, the right-angled triangles began to appear on the screens. This sent shivers up my spine. These are 10 year-olds.
Text: In another 30 minutes they would reach the Theory of Relativity. And then?
In this video, I want to talk a little bit about acceleration. Acceleration. And this is probably an idea that you are somewhat familiar with or at least you've heard the term used here or there.
Our final velocity is 60 mph. And our original velocity was 0 mph, so it's 60 minus 0 mph. And then what is our time?
What is our time over here? Well, our time is, or we could even say our change in time, our change in time is 3 seconds. 3 seconds.
Let me write this down. So this becomes... This top part is 60.
We have miles... Instead of writing mph I'm going to write miles per hour.
That's exactly what this is talking about. Now, we can also write it like this, this is the same thing as 20 miles per hour... Cause if you take something and divide it by second, that's the same thing as multiplying it by 1 over second.
So once again, it's not as intuitive. But we can make this so it's all in one unit of time. Althought you don't really have to.
All of those are legitime ways to interpret this thing in magenta right over here.
And then you multiply. Do a little dimensional analysis. Hour cancels with hour, and then you have...
This will be equal to 20/3600.
20/3600. Miles per seconds times seconds. Or we could say, miles...
Or you could say, miles per second... I want to do that in another colour. Miles per second squared.
Miles per seconds...
Miles per second squared. And we can simplify this a little bit. Divide the denominator and numerator by ten.
With all the legitimate concerns about AlDS and avian flu -- and we'll hear about that from the brilliant Dr. Brilliant later today --
I want to talk about the other pandemic, which is cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension -- all of which are completely preventable for at least 95 percent of people just by changing diet and lifestyle. And what's happening is that there's a globalization of illness occurring, that people are starting to eat like us, and live like us, and die like us.
And for the last almost 29 years, we've been able to show that by simply changing diet and lifestyle, using these very high-tech, expensive, state-of-the-art measures to prove how powerful these very simple and low-tech and low-cost interventions can be like -- quantitative arteriography, before and after a year, and cardiac PET scans. We showed a few months ago -- we published the first study showing you can actually stop or reverse the progression of prostate cancer by making changes in diet and lifestyle, and 70 percent regression in the tumor growth, or inhibition of the tumor growth, compared to only nine percent in the control group. And in the MRI and MR spectroscopy here, the prostate tumor activity is shown in red -- you can see it diminishing after a year.
Now these are not election returns, these are the people -- the number of the people who are obese by state, beginning in '85, '86, '87 -- these are from the CDC website -- '88, '89, '90, '91 -- you get a new category -- '92, '93, '94, '95, '96, '97, '98, '99, 2000, 2001 -- it gets worse. We're kind of devolving.
Now what can we do about this? Well, you know, the diet that we've found that can reverse heart disease and cancer is an Asian diet. But the people in Asia are starting to eat like we are, which is why they're starting to get sick
like -- I chair the advisory boards to McDonald's, and PepsiCo, and ConAgra, and Safeway, and soon
Del Monte, and they're finding that it's good business.
The salads that you see at McDonald's came from the work -- they're going to have an Asian salad. At
Pepsi, two-thirds of their revenue growth came from their better foods. And so if we can do that, then we can free up resources for buying drugs that you really do need for treating AlDS and HlV and malaria and for preventing avian flu. Thank you.
As we've already talked about as we exit the 1800s and we get to the early 1900s and we approach World War I the various powers of Europe are really on this race for empire; it was part of national prestige and it helped build national wealth But of the major powers Germany and Italy were relatively new as unified states. The British Empire had been building their empire for hundreds of years; the Germans on the other hand, even though they have a very old culture going back hundreds, or you could argue thousands of years, as a unified state they only existed since 1871.
Eritrea, and parts of what's today Somalia. And Germany had control -- it also had holdings in Africa, possessions in Africa:
Togoland, which is modern-day Togo, Cameroon which makes up er... which modern-day Cameroon is part of; German Southwest Africa that's now known as Namibia; German East Africa which is now Tanzania, Rwanda and Burundi. And Germany also had holdings in the Pacific and even in China.
Tsingtao is now a very popular Chinese brand of beer; I think it is the number 2 in the market - uh... Chinese beer and it's associated with China but it was actually started by German settlers in Tsingtao in 1903.
Imagine Alice has an idea, and she wants to share it. There are so many ways to share an idea. She could draw a picture, make an engraving, write a song,
send a telegraph, or an email. But how are these things different? And more importantly, why are they the same?
This story is about the fundamental particle of all forms of communication. It begins with a special skill you likely take for granted -- language.
Think of it as the 'language of coins.' So how is information actually measured? Does information have a speed limit?
We are in a Louvre and we are looking at painting by one of the David followers one of his students. An artists whos name is quite long but is usually just shortened to Giordet And the title of the paiting is "Sleep of Endymion" .
Leonardo's use of sfumato, and I am thinking about of some of the later manners, painters. And I think we have in some ways the begginings of romanticism. In the figure that is really languid and sensual.
Firefox Flicks, the global video contest, is back And this time, it's all about the power of mobile You can make any kind of flick you like
On the last evening of my 25th college reunion, there was a party in a tent with dancing, and music, and noise. So much noise that a lot of us started to drift out of the tent so we could hear each other talk and catch up with classmates that we had not seen in more than 2 decades. As I talked with my friends I made an astounding discovery:
"I don't know what my life is all about."
I was privileged to go to Yale, and we were standing on a summer evening in the middle of Yale's old campus, and the people that I was speaking with were privileged, and highly educated, and financially well off, and in positions of power. And they had the first house, and the second house, and they had the first spouse, and the second spouse. (Laughter)
(Audience) Yes. Can you be a little bit louder? Because they are making a lot of noise in the tent, and there is just a silly little microphone next to my cheek to hear you.
(Audience) Yes! Thank you. Actually, it's not even going to take five minutes.
Shall we do it? (Audience) Yes. All right.
(Audience responds) What do you do?
(Audience responds) Who do you do it for?
(Audience responds) What do they want or need?
(Audience responds) How do they change as a result?
(Audience responds) Fantastic.
You have all just done something that people who went to Yale could not figure out for 25 years. Congratulations. Give yourselves a hand.
(Laughter) Or, it's that other thing, so he can tell me what he does because he's sure it's, "Oh, really, so much better than what I do?" (Laughter)
"I design apparel for men and women who need affordable choices, so they can look and feel their best." Or you might say: "I help people get great work into the world," if your life purpose is:
"I train entrepreneurs and creative people to take decisive actions, so they can get their greatest work into the world." And then, that little snippet that you just said becomes your personal elevator pitch. And it will always start a conversation because the person that you were just talking to has to ask you a question,
"How do you give kids great dreams?" "How do you help people look and feel their best?" "Can people really get their greatest work into the world?"

It's before we think about how the business is structured. It doesn't think about things like interest income from your bank account, or interest expense on any loans you have. It's from the business itself, operating profit, and since these are identical businesses, they have the same exact operating profit.
Ben has no interest expense, while Jason does have a $10,000 interest expense, so it's about 10% per year.
That's why these two income statements start to diverge, but notice, we didn't put this expense up there because it has nothing to do with the operations. It's dependent on how the operations were financed. Once you subtract that out, then you actually have your pre-tax income, and if we assume that we have to pay taxes, this is how much we pay in taxes, and this is actually the net income that goes to the owners of the company.
Hello everyone. And so the two of us are here to give you an example of creation. And I'm going to be folding one of Robert Lang's models.
In this video, I want to introduce you to the idea of a list, of a list in python.
It is one of the most powerful data structures in Python, and it really is just a sequence of a bunch of other stuff. So a list in Python would look something like this: So this would be a list of integers,
You do that by referring to the index of the element inside of the list. So, if I say a and then in brackets, I put a zero here. This says the 0th element in a, 0th elment... and the general convention in Python, and this is true of most programming languages, is what some people would consider the first item in an array, or inside of a list you would call it the 0th item, or the index of this item right here, is 0.
But, what is really cool with lists ... is that they don't have to all be the same data type. They could be all integers, or all floats... or all strings... but you could mix it up. So you could... you could...
Let's reset the fourth element in a to be equal to... to be equal to.."this text" So literally "this text".
Literally "this text" and so If you did that.. if you set the fourth element be "this text" and then you and your program say print.. print a..print a then a... would look like this.
The 0th element wouldn't change. Still be 1 The first element will stil be -7
This two index element would still be 0 This will be the third. So this is 0th index.
It will now be...this....will now be "this text" ...the second...we wanna try out with Python intrepreter and the last element will still be..... The last element will still be 10. and this will completely valid to do in Python.
You can mix data type. In fact, you could even...if you..after..after you did this, you could even say..that..a Let's redefine the 0th element of a.. to be another list.
To be the list -1, -2. and if you did this, then this 0th element over here, will in the list, the 0th element will now refer to this thing.
So the list would now look like this. So the first element or the 0th element I should say will be this thing.
Negative 1, negative 2. And then you'd have you're negative seven, zero, zero, this text and then you'll have your 10, just like that. So you define it this way and literally replaces or the 0th element will now refer to this data structure over here and you could maybe already imagine useful ways to use this in programs and if you can't don't worry about it.
Factor t squared plus 8t plus 15. So let's just think about what happen if we multiply 2 binomials t plus a times t plus b And I'm using t here because t is the variable in the polynomial that we need to factor.
Imagine we are living in prehistoric times. Now, consider the following: How did we keep track of time without a clock?
The trick is to use a "Ulam spiral." First, we list all possible numbers in order in a growing spiral. Then, we color all the prime numbers blue.
 Let's review a little bit of what we've learned about reserve banking and then we'll extend this to the notion of an elastic money supplier, a money supplier that can grow or contract as people need money-- or hopefully grows and contracts as people need money. So let me create a a couple of normal commercial banks.
It's a private bank, but we'll go into more details of of how the actual Federal Reserve works. So those are the actual gold reserves. Those are the assets of that bank.
And let's say in the government we live in, they kind of sanction-- even though this is officially a private bank, this reserve bank, it's set up in such a way that even though all of the original banks might have originally capitalized it with some equity, they really don't get any of the profits of this bank-- and I'll go into detail on how the actual Federal Reserve works. But let's just say any surplus profits of this bank actually just go back to the Federal government.
So the Federal government doesn't-- these banks don't make any money off of this-- and actually let's say that the board of directors of this bank is actually appointed by the government, et cetera, et cetera. So it's key to the financial system. So the government says, these notes, sure, it's issued by this reserve bank, but we want people to have a lot of faith in this currency because this is the currency that we use in our world, in our nation, so in order for people to have unlimited faith in this currency, we are going to make it an obligation of the government-- so it's issued by the bank.
learn how this Federal Reserve bank or this reserve bank can buy and sell these government securities in order to change the money supply.
How often do we hear that people just don't care? How many times have you been told that real, substantial change isn't possible because most people are too selfish, too stupid or too lazy to try to make a difference in their community? I propose to you today that apathy as we think we know it doesn't actually exist; but rather, that people do care, but that we live in a world that actively discourages engagement by constantly putting obstacles and barriers in our way.
You'll never see an ad like that, because Nike actually wants you to buy their shoes, whereas the city of Toronto clearly doesn't want you involved with the planning process, otherwise their ads would look something like this, with all the information laid out clearly. As long as the city's putting out notices like this to try to get people engaged, then of course people aren't going to be engaged. But that's not apathy; that's intentional exclusion.
The "Now" magazine from last week: progressive, downtown weekly in Toronto. This is the cover story. It's an article about a theater performance, and it starts with basic information about where it is, in case you actually want to go and see it after you've read the article -- where, the time, the website.
So my name is Taylor Wilson. I am 17 years old and I am a nuclear physicist, which may be a little hard to believe, but I am. And I would like to make the case that nuclear fusion will be that point, that the bridge that T. Boone Pickens talked about will get us to.
I won the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair. I developed a detector that replaces the current detectors that Homeland Security has. For hundreds of dollars,
In which quadrant is the point -7, 7 located? So let's just review what a quadrant is A quadrant is each of the four sections of the coordinate plane. and when we talk about the sections we're talking about the sections as divided by the coordinate axis.
Good morning. Let's look for a minute at the greatest icon of all, Leonardo da Vinci. We're all familiar with his fantastic work -- his drawings, his paintings, his inventions, his writings.
Leonardo was a man that drew everything around him. He drew people, anatomy, plants, animals, landscapes, buildings, water, everything. But no faces?
It's a statue made by Verrocchio, of David, for which Leonardo posed as a boy of 15. And if we now compare the face of the statue, with the face of the musician, you see the very same features again. The statue is the reference, and it connects the identity of Leonardo to those three faces.
The human eye is one of the most powerful machines on the planet. It's like a 500 megapixel camera that can run in bright light, in near darkness, and even under water, though not real well. It communicates to our brains so much about the world.
"Look, ma! No hooves!" Since then, photography has found its way into all aspects of math and science.
We have talked a little bit about the law of demand which tells us that, all else equal, if we raise the price of a product, then the quantity demanded for that product will go down. ..common sense. If we lower the price, the quantity demanded will go up. And we will see so in a few special cases for this.
Or maybe the price of a....the price of a Kindle goes up, [WRlTING] so the price of a Kindle...let me write it this way:
Kindle's price goes up. [WRlTING]
Now the Kindle is not a substitute. People don't either buy an e-book or they won't either buy my ebook or buy a Kindle.
Kindle is a complement, you actually need a Kindle or an Ipad or something like it in order to consume my ebook.
So this right over here, this right over here is a complement. It is a complement. [WRlTING]
So in this situation, if my book is $2, since fewer people are going to have Kindles, or maybe they have used some of their money already to buy the Kindle, they're gonna have less to buy my book or just fewer people will have the Kindle.
For any given price, it's going to lower the quantity demanded. For any given price. And so essentially, it will shift, it will change the entire demand curve.
Deflection is zero.
Deflection does not return to zero. Squeeze coins together. Deflection increases!
So magic is a very introverted field. While scientists regularly publish their latest research, we magicians do not like to share our methods and secrets. That's true even amongst peers.
(Applause) (Music) Terribly sorry. I forgot the floor.
Wake up. Hey. Come on.
Okay. He figured out the system. (Music) (Laughter) (Applause) (Music)
(Music) (Laughter) (Music) Hey. (Music)
A line passes through the points negative 3, 6 and 6, 0. Find the equation of this line in point slope form, slope intercept form, standard form. And the way to think about these, these are just three different ways of writing the same equation.
Slope intercept form is y is equal to mx plus b, where once again m is the slope, b is the y-intercept-- where does the line intersect the y-axis-- what value does y take on when x is 0?
And then standard form is the form ax plus by is equal to c, where these are just two numbers, essentially. They really don't have any interpretation directly on the graph. So let's do this, let's figure out all of these forms.
Once we figure out the slope, then point slope form is actually very, very, very straightforward to calculate. So, just to remind ourselves, slope, which is equal to m, which is going to be equal to the change in y over the change in x. Now what is the change in y?
Well, our starting x value is that right over there, that's that negative 3. And just to make sure we know what we're doing, this negative 3 is that negative 3, right there. I'm just saying, if we go from that point to that point, our y went down by 6, right?
Well, we can multiply out the negative 2/3, so you get y minus 6 is equal to-- I'm just distributing the negative 2/3-- so negative 2/3 times x is negative 2/3 x.
And then negative 2/3 times 3 is negative 2. And now to get it in slope intercept form, we just have to add the 6 to both sides so we get rid of it on the left-hand side, so let's add 6 to both sides of this equation.
Negative 2 plus 6 is plus 4. So there you have it, that is our slope intercept form, mx plus b, that's our y-intercept. Now the last thing we need to do is get it into the standard form.
It is 2/3 x, because 2 over 3x, plus this y, that's my left-hand side, is equal to-- these guys cancel out-- is equal to 4. So this, by itself, we are in standard form, this is the standard form of the equation.
This is my grandfather. And this is my son. My grandfather taught me to work with wood when I was a little boy, and he also taught me the idea that if you cut down a tree to turn it into something, honor that tree's life and make it as beautiful as you possibly can.
But do remember when you were a kid, and you kind of sifted through the pile in your basement, and you found that big 24-dot brick of Lego, and you were kind of like, "Cool, this is awesome. I can build something really big, and this is going to be great."
Gustave Eiffel was building the Eiffel Tower, and as he built the Eiffel Tower, he changed the skylines of the cities of the world, changed and created a competition between places like New York City and Chicago, where developers started building bigger and bigger buildings and pushing the envelope up higher and higher with better and better engineering. We built this model in New York, actually, as a theoretical model on the campus of a technical university soon to come, and the reason we picked this site to just show you what these buildings may look like, because the exterior can change. It's really just the structure that we're talking about.
Hi there, I'm John Green; you're watching Crash Course: World History, and today we're gonna talk about the Silk Road,
Imagine that you live in North America. And one day you call off your friend in Norway, up by the North Pole. You guys are talking, and you make plans to go visit him next summer.
"So, any time next summer works for you?"
"Yep, any time is good for me."
"Okay, how about June? That's summer for you, right?" "Of course."
"What? I don't get this. Why is the sun still up in the middle of the night here in Norway?"
If we take a look at the Earth's orbit from the side, we see that the Earth revolves around the sun in this orbital plane, once every year. Remember that Earth is tilted at an angle of 23.5 degrees. And it's rotating on its axis, once every day.
"Okay. But how does that keep the sun from setting during the summer in Norway?" I think it's best if we explain this through an experiment.
Yeah, there we go. We can see that the half of the Earth that's facing the sun is lit up. It's daytime on this half and nighttime on the other half.
"Oh, awesome. That's so cool! 24 hours of sunlight!
"Not in the winter."
"What do you mean?" Let's take a look at Norway in the winter. During this season, the northern hemisphere is tilted away from the sun.
"Oh man, that stinks."
"It sure does." The same thing happens between the Antarctic Circle and the south pole, too. During their summer, they have 24 hours of sunlight.
"That's crazy!" Even if you don't live far north or south, the tilt of the Earth still affects the length of the day. If it's the June solstice, we have 24 hours of sunlight here above the Arctic Circle and 24 hours of darkness here, below the Antarctic Circle.
"Ha." So, if we were to go a little south to the U.S, between the equator and the Arctic Circle how many hours of daylight do you think we'll have?
"Less than 24." Right! It's the longest day of the year in the northern hemisphere.
"Less than 12." Exactly! This is the shortest day of the year in the southern hemisphere.
"Awesome. I think it's time for some celebratory summer midnight mini-golf, right, partner?
 What we're going to do in this video is, through a bunch of examples, familiarize ourselves with the x,y-coordinate plane. And first we're going to just look at some points that are already plotted and figure out their coordinates.
D, x-coordinate negative 2. You see that right there. y-coordinate negative 2, as well. Let me get another color.
E, let's do the y-coordinate. We'll figure it out first, but you always have to write it second. It's negative 4.
The x-coordinate is 2. And the y-coordinate is negative 6. Hopefully that gives you a sense of at least figuring out the coordinates.
Negative 4, negative 4. And just to familiarize yourself with a labeling scheme that you may or may not have seen before, is that people label these sections of the coordinate plane. They call this the first quadrant.
IV, So this point is in the third quadrant. When we looked up at this stuff over here, these points are in the fourth quadrant. These are in the third, second, first.
Both of its coordinates are positive. 3 comma 3. Both x and y are positive.
It's going to have to be on the same vertical as this point, which means it's going to have the same x value as this point. So its x value is going to be negative 4. And then it's going to have to be on the same horizontal as this point.
Notice it's at negative 4, right above A. And it's at y is equal to 3.
Right to the left of point C. And we are done.
There are three groups of influenza viruses which we call virus types.
And these three types are influenza A, B and C.
So we group influenza viruses like this because of the differences that they have in genetic material or their genome.
So the genome in an influenza A virus is very different than the genome in the influenza B virus.
And there are many more differences between A and B than there are between two influenza A viruses.
So I'm focusing right now on influenza A and B viruses because these are the types that cause sickness and epidemics every winter in the United States.
I'm not focusing on influenza type C because this is much less common in humans and actually isn't even included in the annual vaccine. So now lets get back to the differences between individual virus types.
So - ahm - the influenza type A is a very large group of viruses, much larger than the type B.
And so we need to further divide this group according to subtype and the subtype is named according to surface proteins that are on the outside of every virus.
So there are two kinds of surface proteins on every influenza A virus and we call these H for hemagglutinin and N for neuraminidase.
Now these surface proteins come in many different flavors.
There are actually 17 different kinds of hemagglutinin proteins and 10 different kinds of neuraminidase proteins.
So when a virus replicates its genome is going to determine what kinds of H and N proteins will show up on the surface of the virus.
So you can imagine that there are a lot of different combinations of these viruses.
So H1-N1 could be a potential combination. Maybe H3-N2 and so on.
And actually, H1-N1 and H3-N2 are the subtypes that we see in humans today.
So the combinations of proteins that we see in these viruses is very important because this is what the immune system sees when a virus enters the body.
It sees what's on the outside of the virus. So when you have two viruses that are the same or that look the same on the outside and if the immune system knows what to do with one of them, it will know what to do with the other one. But if you have a virus come along that looks very different from a virus that the immune stem has ever seen before it's going to be very confused and not know what to do with this new virus.
An emulsion is a uniform mixture of oily substances and watery substances which usually don't mix. To take the most common example of salad dressing, ah, you'll know that olive oil and vinegar don't mix unless you add the egg to it then you can froth it up and make a uniform mixture of the two. Well, in paint, emulsions work the same way in fact, one of the same emulsifiers is used and that is egg yolk. de Kooning among others would add egg to his oil paint which is typically compatible with the solvent, turpentine but after adding egg yolk, it was compatible with water as well.
"What is the image of the polygon below after the translation T [with the subscript]
So we need to go essentially -8.
[Counting as he shifts]: -1, -2. Or we need to move to the left 1.
we're asked to simply log base 3 of 27x and frankly this is already quite simple, but I'm assuming they want us to use some logarithm properties and manipulate this some way maybe actually make it a little more complicated and let's give this our best shot at it so the logarithm property that jumps out at me because this, right over here, is saying what power do we have to raise 3 to in order to get 27x 27x is the same thing as 27 times x and so the logarithm property it seems like they want us to use is
log base b of a times c this is equal to the logarithm base b of a plus logarithm base b of c now this comes straight out of the exponent properties that if you have two exponents with the same base you can add the exponents now let me make this a little bit clearer to you now if this part is a little confusing the important part for this example is is that you know how to apply this, but it's even better if you know the intuition so let's say that log, let's say that log base b of a times c is equal to x so this thing right over here evaluates to x
let's say that this thing right over here evaluates to y so log base b of a is equal to y and let's say that that this thing over here evaluates to z so log base b of c is equal to z now, what we know is this thing right over here, this thing right over here or this thing right over here tells us tells us that b, to the x power is equal to a times c now, this right over here is telling us that b to the y power is equal to a and this over here is telling us that b to the z power is equal to c
let me do that in that same green so i'm just writing the same truth i'm writing as an exponential function or exponential equation instead of a logarithmic equation so b to the zth power is equal to c these are all, this is the same statement this is the same statement or they're the same truth said in a different way and this is the same truth said in a different way well if we know that, if we know that a is equal to this, is equal to b to the y, we can, and c is equal to b-z then we can write b to the x power is equal to b to the y power that's what a is, we know that already times b to the z power times b to the z power and we know, from our exponent properites we know from our exponent properties That if we take b to the y times b to the z this is the same thing as: b to the, I'll do it in neutral color, b to the y plus z power this came straight out of our exponent properties. And so if b to the y plus z power is the same thing b to the x power -- that tells us that x must be equal to y plus z. x must be equal to y plus z.
You have to just realise that logarithms are really just exponents. I know, when people at first tell me: what does that mean? But when you evaluate a logarithm - you're getting an exponent that you would have to raise b to, in order to get a times c.
log base 3 of 27 times x -- I'll write it that way -- is equal to log base 3 of 27 plus log base 3 of x.
And then this right over here we can evaluate, this tells us: what power do I have to raise 3 to get to 27. You can view it this way: 3 to the question mark is equal to 27.
Log base 3 of 27x. So once again -- not clear that this is simpler than this right over here. It's just another way of writing it using logarithm properties.
I think you'll find this video exciting because until now, we've just been talking about the Federal reserve in the abstract and I was drawing little boxes to represent balance sheets, but this is the actual Federal reserve balance sheet and I took a date that was before all of this silliness started happening in the banking sector just so we could kind of see what a Federal reserve balance would've looked like in a normal environment.
And then we can actually, in future videos, compare what they've done since then and then we can get a better insight into all of the different machinations that the Federal reserve has done to kind of try to keep banks
liquid and solvent and to keep everything going. And we can debate whether they've been good or bad or they're just keeping banks in kind of zombie mode.
But anyway, this is the Federal reserve's balance sheet as of February 14th, 2007. So before all the craziness happened, although a little bit started-- this is before the Feds started taking really aggressive action to provide liquidity for the markets. But here the assets.
The liabilities are $840 billion, give or take a little bit.
They should have the same width, not that the width matters that much. And then whatever's left over should be equity, right?
Assets minus liabilities. What you have minus what you owe is what you're left with for the owners. And of course, owners of the Federal reserve, you kind of have to take with a grain of salt.
So big picture, so far it's kind of meeting up with how we've envisioned a Federal reserve balance sheet, but let's dig a little deeper and see if we can find interesting things and things we've talked about. And hopefully at this point, we should actually understand all of it.
So the assets are just this part of it.
OK. So it has-- this is what? This is $11 billion of gold certificate accounts and that's some type of rights on gold.
Gold certificate accounts. Let's see if they have any other gold anywhere.
Coin-- $1 billion. But this is all small potatoes, right? I don't know what special drawing rights certificate account is, but it's very small relative to the big pie, right?
So just to explain, a treasury bill-- and I've done videos on this-- this is essentially a loan to the government for a year or less. So it's just a loan to the government that matures in a year or in three months.
Notes and bonds-- these are loans to the U.S. treasury that have longer maturities.
Notes are up to 10 years.
Bonds are more than 10 years. And then inflation index bonds-- I'll do a whole video on that in the future, but these are essentially treasuries that are indexed to inflation so you can kind of hedge out a little bit of your inflation risk. But, needless to say, the big picture is is that $780 billion of the Fed's assets are treasuries, loans to the
Federal government. Let me draw that here. So a pretty big piece, roughly that much is treasury.
Fed agreed to buy it later, but it's essentially collateral. So these repurchase agreements-- they're included in these securities because they're not just agreements, right? They actually are-- they're probably treasuries or they might be other types of highly rated securities and we'll
That's pretty much peanuts in the Federal reserve world. So the bulk is treasuries, a little bit of repurchase agreements, and then there's other assets. They don't break out what this is.
Bank premises, the buildings of the Federal reserve are worth $2 billion. I mean, they have 12 banks around the country and I'm sure they have a bunch of other things. And then items in process collection.
The big thing is that the Federal reserve's assets are predominantly U.S. treasuries-- at least, they're predominantly treasuries right now. Now let's look at the liabilities. And to some degree, this is much more interesting.
The U.S. treasury actually keeps some money there.
Depository institutions have $17 billion-- and actually, that's how the Federal reserve traditionally has paid its expenses. People put deposits with the Federal reserve-- so let's say these are deposits from banks. It's a very small piece.
U.S. Treasury so it's not like Ben Bernanke can fly around or drive a Bentley or something. And then I don't know what this is-- foreign official-- these are nothing items. So the bulk of it is money that had been printed and that's a liability of the Federal reserve now.
And then there's a little bit of deposits from depository institutions. And the treasury has kept some money with the Federal reserve as well.
(piano playing) I think sometimes when we're talking about our history, we forget that the people who are making this are really artists.
What we have up on the screen is a San Cassiano altarpiece painting by Giovanni Bellini who is known for this vivid color and very complex, sort of atmospheres, glorious luminosity in his paintings. In fact, he used oil paint in a really interesting way. Oil paint has a kind of translucency and he really used that to advantage, but in a way that modern painters don't generally.
Isaac, when you paint, you don't go and grind your minerals and add linseed oil to it, do you?
Isaac: No, not at all. But that's what they would have done in the time of Bellini.
Isaac: Well, it comes from northern painting. Oil paint have different consistencies depending on what varnish you use with them.
Dammar resin is just a natural tree sap. It looks just like amber. It's like a jewel and what you do is dissolve this into turpentine and then mix it with the oil paint in order to make these transparent glass-like, they're just panes of paint.
The light can enter through all of them and go to the white surface before it reflects back.
So, I think a lot of people have this idea of oil paint as being kind of a thick and gooey substance, but the way that you're talking about it with Renaissance artists applying thin glazes of color and many layers of that, it's a very, very different idea of oil paint application.
But what dammar does, is dammar speeds up the drying a little bit.
The Great Western Railway. So, you think Turner is actually mixing the paints on the canvas?
Isaac: I think so. Yeah.
This tempera is relatively flat, as is acrylic and, sort of, the best tempera I think of is Botticelli's work where it's very linear and all the colors form these flat, kind of, interlaced lines. Female: Like hatching?
Isaac: Yeah, like hatching. The basic unit of the painting is line, but in oils the basic unit is surface or atmosphere.
My position, I guess, on Turner, knowing the rapidity of his pace is that with this painting, yeah, he probably let the colors be alive and mix them on top of each other and allow them to penetrate each other and emerge and sink down beneath one another. Narrator: That sounds so much more as if the process of painting exists in this direct confrontation of the artist and the canvas as opposed to something that's much more premeditated, much more sort of worked out and more completely preconceived.
Isaac: Right. Narrator: ... how much of a role media played ...
You know, oil paint is the most historical medium.
The associations of being feminine and delicate.
Isaac: Yeah. Female:
Yeah, but now I'm kind of interested in those issues.
I would be willing to bet that I'm the dumbest guy in the room because I couldn't get through school. I struggled with school. But what I knew at a very early age was that I loved money and I loved business and I loved this entrepreneurial thing, and I was raised to be an entrepreneur, and what I've been really passionate about ever since -- and I've never spoken about this ever, until now -- so this is the first time anyone's ever heard it, except my wife three days ago, because she said, "What are you talking about?" and I told her -- is that I think we miss an opportunity to find these kids who have the entrepreneurial traits, and to groom them or show them that being an entrepreneur is actually a cool thing.
"Hey, this kid's a good speaker. He can't focus, but he loves walking around and getting people energized."
No one said, "Get him a coach in speaking." They said, get me a tutor in what I suck at. So as kids show these traits -- and we need to start looking for them --
Unfortunately the school system is grooming this world to say, "Hey, let's be a lawyer or let's be a doctor," and we're missing that opportunity because no one ever says, "Hey, be an entrepreneur." Entrepreneurs are people -- because we have a lot of them in this room -- who have these ideas and these passions or see these needs in the world and we decide to stand up and do it. And we put everything on the line to make that stuff happen.
"Don't be an entrepreneurial type. Fit into this other system and try to become a student." Sorry, entrepreneurs aren't students.
The definition of an entrepreneur is "a person who organizes, operates and assumes the risk of a business venture." That doesn't mean you have to go to an MBA program. It doesn't mean you have to get through school.
"Where are you going to get the coat hangers to sell to the dry cleaners?" And I said, "Let's go and look in the basement." And we went down to the basement.
And he said, "Yes, that's my wife's car." And I said, "Why don't we just test one on the front of your wife's car and see if it lasts longer." So I knew there were two cars with two license plates on each. If I couldn't sell all four, I could at least get one.
It was, "Which color would you like?" Like I'm 10 years old; you're not going to say no to me, especially if you have two options -- you have the brown one or the clear one. So I learned that lesson at a young age.
That doesn't make any sense." You just figure out a way to make more money faster. Every week, I would go to the corner store and buy all these pops. Then I would go up and deliver them to these 70-year-old women playing bridge.
"Maybe I'll start contributing to my RSP now." Shit, you've missed 25 years. You can teach those habits to young kids when they don't even feel the pain yet.
Say, "By the way, that guy's a crappy employee."
And say, "These ones are good ones." (Laughter) If you go into a restaurant and you have bad customer service, show them what bad customer service looks like.
Imagine if you actually took all the kids' junk that's in the house right now, all the toys that they've outgrown two years ago and said, "Why don't we start selling some of this on Craigslist and Kijiji?" And they can actually sell it and learn how to find scammers when they get email offers come in. They can come into your account or a sub account or whatever.
["It still is."]
Thank you very much for having me.
I've talked a lot about the importance of hemoglobin in our red blood cells so I thought I would dedicate an entire video to hemoglobin. One-- because it's important, but also it explains a lot about how the hemoglobin-- or the red blood cells, depending on what level you want to operate-- know, and I have to use know in quotes. These aren't sentient beings, but how do they know when to pick up the oxygen and when to drop off the oxygen?
And if you watch the video on chlorophyil, you'd remember a porphyrin structure, but at the very center of it, in chlorophyil, we had a magnesium ion, but at the very center of hemoglobin, we have an iron ion and this is where the oxygen binds. So on this hemoglobin, you have four major binding sites for oxygen. You have right there, maybe right there, a little bit behind, right there, and right there.
When you talk about allosteric anything-- it's often using the context of enzymes-- you're talking about the idea that things bind to other parts.
Allo means other. So you're binding to other parts of the protein or the enzyme-- and enzymes are just proteins-- and it affects the ability of the protein or the enzyme to do what it normally does. So hemoglobin is allosterically inhibited by carbon dioxide and by protons.
It's called carbonic anhydrase. A reaction will occur-- essentially you'll end up with carbonic acid.
We have H2CO3. It's all balanced. We have three oxygens, two hydrogens, one carbon.
The FlFA World Cup has been held 19 times since 1930. Brazil has won the cup 5 times since it began. Based on this data, estimate the probability that Brazil will win the next World Cup to be held in Rio de Janeiro in 2014.
What I want to do in this video is to expose you and introduce you to the idea to what a computer program is. And just in case you want to follow along I highly recommend you do that because the real way to learn computer science is to really fiddle with things yourself.
P-Y-S-C-R-I-P-T-E-R. It's free. It's an open-source piece of software.
And so let's save it. I just type CTRL+S, That's a shortcut to save this. and then I'll try to run this program.
So you can say a=3+5, then we can say b=a*a-a-1 [note: * means "times", it is used for multiplication.] and then you can say c=a*b Then you can have something like... I will put some space here just to make it a little bit cleaner. c = a*b
So any place in the program, until we redefine "a", any time you use "a", it's going to say: a is 8. a is referring to 8. So when you go down over here, we're defining "b" it'll say OK, a*a. It uses order of operations.
Let's make it equal to -6 Now let's run our program to see what happens.
We get -246. And you can verify it by yourself. You go line by line, and have these variables refer to what they are defined to be referring to, and see if you get this response right over here.
It's amazing how much you can get done with just these conditionals. So this is saying if "a" is less than 0, do this,
Otherwise if "a" is not less than 0, do this over here. So notice we are not going just straight down.
Depending on whether "a" is less than 0 or not, it's going to either execute this line, or it's going to execute this line.
And the way that Python knew to only execute this line, if "a" was less than 0 is it's indented here. And the indent is part of this clause. The way it knows that there are new clauses forming right here is this colon right over here.
If "a" is not less than 0, then it's within this "else" clause. And If you want to do something else after this, regardless of whether "a" is less than 0 or not, You can just take it out of the clause by getting rid of the indentation.
"we are done with the program". Actually, let's do add some other stuff in this clause. So let's print here "a&lt;0".
But then it breaks out of this clause and prints this no matter what: "we are done with the program"
Let's just change "a" to try to see if we can get this other clause to break.
Let's make "a" greater than 0.
So let's make "a" equal to 9 and now let's run the program. So there. "a" is 9. So it says "is a less than 0?".
It's going to go to the else clause. So it's going to print "a is not less than 0" which it did over here. Then it printed c-a which is 630.
And regardless of whether "a" is less than 0 or not, it prints "we are done with the program".
Solve for z 5z + 7 is less than 27 OR negative 3z is less than or equal to 18. So this is a compound inequality. We have two conditions here.
Z is less than 4. Now this is only one of the conditions. Lets go to the other one over here:
Welcome to "Five Dangerous Things You Should Let Your Children Do." I don't have children. I borrow my friends' children, so -- (Laughter) take all this advice with a grain of salt.
We put warnings on coffee cups to tell us that the contents may be hot. And we seem to think that any item sharper than a golf ball is too sharp for children under the age of 10. So where does this trend stop?
Ten years ago, on a Tuesday morning, I conducted a parachute jump at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. It was a routine training jump, like many more I'd done since I became a paratrooper 27 years before.
Boom. So then you look around, you're under a canopy and you say, "This is good." Now you prepare for the inevitable.
"Why didn't I go into banking?" (Laughter) And I'd look around, and then I'd see another paratrooper, a young guy or girl, and they'd have pulled out their M4 carbine and they'd be picking up their equipment.
But in my first 25 years of career, I had a bunch of different experiences. One of my first battalion commanders,
They put a big screen up, and they take you through everything: "and then you didn't do this, and you didn't do this, etc." I walked out feeling as low as a snake's belly in a wagon rut. And I saw my battalion commander, because I had let him down.
When 9/11 came, 46-year-old Brig. Gen. McChrystal sees a whole new world. First, the things that are obvious, that you're familiar with: the environment changed -- the speed, the scrutiny, the sensitivity of everything now is so fast, sometimes it evolves faster than people have time to really reflect on it. But everything we do is in a different context.
I asked, "Where were you on 9/11?" And one young Ranger in the back -- his hair's tousled and his face is red and windblown from being in combat in the cold Afghan wind -- he said, "Sir, I was in the sixth grade." And it reminded me that we're operating a force that must have shared purpose and shared consciousness, and yet he has different experiences, in many cases a different vocabulary, a completely different skill set in terms of digital media than I do and many of the other senior leaders.
"I'll never leave a fallen comrade to fall into the hands of the enemy." And it's not a mindless mantra, and it's not a poem. It's a promise.
Hi, my name is Marcin -- farmer, technologist.
I was born in Poland, now in the U.S.
I started a group called Open Source Ecology. We've identified the 50 most important machines that we think it takes for modern life to exist -- things from tractors, bread ovens, circuit makers. Then we set out to create an open source, DlY, do it yourself version that anyone can build and maintain at a fraction of the cost.
We call this the Global Village Construction Set. So let me tell you a story. So I finished my 20s with a Ph.D. in fusion energy, and I discovered I was useless.
Let's go into a little more detail on the Treaty of Versailles. We've already talked about it helping to establish the League of Nations, but particularly with regards to Germany, the biggest aspect of it was its application of war guilt, essentially putting the full blame of the war on Germany. Maybe you could justify it by saying

 Pedro is supposed to practice piano for 3/4 of an hour every day. Today, he has practiced for 1/4 of an hour.
You could say, hey, look, this is half of the length of this entire thing. It has a little bit on this end and that end. Or if you make 4 equal blocks, and if you were to shade in 2 of them, you see that you have shaded in 1/2 of the blocks.
Good afternoon, before I get started, I first have to say, hello, to all of my students who let me be out of school today, they're staying late at school to watch the stream.
Hello to everybody out there in Philadelphia, I think they definitely deserve a round of applause. (Applause)
Today, I'm going to tell you a couple of stories. I know I have a bit of a provocative title, I'll get there, go with me.
I take off from Wisconsin and move to Kansas, small town Kansas, where I had an opportunity to teach in a lovely, small-town, rural Kansas school district, where I was teaching my favorite subject,
American government. My first year - super gung-ho - going to teach American government, loved the political system.
"Oh, there she is. That's so cute. She's trying to get that done."
"She doesn't know what she's in for." But I knew that the kids would show up, and I believed it, and I told them every week what I expected out of them. And that night, all 90 kids - dressed appropriately, doing their job, owning it.
From Kansas, I moved on to lovely Arizona, where I taught in Flagstaff for a number of years, this time with middle school students.
Luckily, I didn't have to teach them American government. Could teach them the more exciting topic of geography. Again, "thrilled" to learn.
And one opportunity was we got to go and meet Paul Rusesabagina, which is the gentleman that the movie "Hotel Rwanda" is based after.
And he was going to speak at the high school next door to us. We could walk there. We didn't even have to pay for the buses.
I teach at the Science Leadership Academy, which is a partnership school between the Franklin Institute and the school district of Philadelphia. We are a nine through 12 public school, but we do school quite differently. I moved there primarily to be part of a learning environment that validated the way that I knew that kids learned, and that really wanted to investigate what was possible when you are willing to let go of some of the paradigms of the past, of information scarcity when my grandmother was in school and when my father was in school and even when I was in school, and to a moment when we have information surplus.
In Philadelphia we have a one-to-one laptop program, so the kids are bringing in laptops with them everyday, taking them home, getting access to information. And here's the thing that you need to get comfortable with when you've given the tool to acquire information to students, is that you have to be comfortable with this idea of allowing kids to fail as part of the learning process. We deal right now in the educational landscape with an infatuation with the culture of one right answer that can be properly bubbled on the average multiple choice test, and I am here to share with you: it is not learning.
Enamel paints are essentially household paints or automotive paints. And they have been used by artists for a long time.
As early as Pablo Picasso in the early Twentieth century. Many abstract expressionist painters used it. But enamel is a tricky term because it doesn't really tell you what type of paint you're talking about, but rather, the properties of that paint.
There is alkyd enamel paint
There is acrylic enamel paint There are latex enamel paints. It just means that the paint is quite fluid.
It's pretty simple. There are nine, sort of, rules that I discovered after 35 years of rock climbing. Most of them are pretty basic.
"How do I get through the hardest part? How do I get through the hardest part?" And then what happens?
I have a report now that they are sending a new rover to Mars, and we are responsible for doing one thing - which is programming the algorithm inside the rover which checks if numbers are prime. Because let's say our rover is communicating using RSA. It needs an algorithm inside that can do a primality test.
Oh, I missed 5 here, sorry about that. 4 4, 6 4, 6, 8 4, 6, 8, 10 ... And instead, we can take a step like this:
lola said, *"Wouldn't leaving the loop as soon we find* *primeCheck == false cut down on some of the time?"*
Algorithm B, as we know, is taking half as many steps in the worst case, but it's still taking many steps here. Because it's the worst case, right? So, we're getting close to crashing here, and this is not a very long prime.
And we also have this cool tool, which allows us to visualize how fast it's growing - how fast the number of steps grows as our input grows. And below, I'll explain how I set this up, so you can set up your algorithm and compare it with the base case, and see how much better you can do.
Solve for x, 5x - 3 is less than 12 "and" 4x plus 1 is greater than 25.
So let's just solve for X in each of these constraints and keep in mind that any x has to satisfy both of them because it's an "and" over here so first we have this 5 x minus 3 is less than 12 so if we want to isolate the x we can get rid of this negative 3 here by adding 3 to both sides so let's add 3 to both sides of this inequality.
The left-hand side, we're just left with a 5x, the minus 3 and the plus 3 cancel out. 5x is less than 12 plus 3 is 15. Now we can divide both sides by positive 5, that won't swap the inequality since 5 is positive.
(bouncy piano music) &gt;&gt; We're in the national gallery in London and we are standing in front of a painting by Sir Joshua Reynolds from 1773. It's Lady Coburn and Her Three Eldest Sons.
Very directly, that sort of a Cupid figure connecting to ideas of Venus and back into that mythological genre that Reynolds really liked to do.
Something that is unusual, of course, is that parrot. Why would there be a parrot in this picture? &gt;&gt; The parrot was actually Reynolds' pet. Not necessarily an allegorical addition, but it's a pet and the story goes that it was added to this painting to even out the composition.
About four years ago, the New Yorker published an article about a cache of dodo bones that was found in a pit on the island of Mauritius.
Now, the island of Mauritius is a small island off the east coast of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean, and it is the place where the dodo bird was discovered and extinguished, all within about 150 years.
Everyone was very excited about this archaeological find, because it meant that they might finally be able to assemble a single dodo skeleton. See, while museums all over the world have dodo skeletons in their collection, nobody -- not even the actual Natural History Museum on the island of Mauritius -- has a skeleton that's made from the bones of a single dodo.
Well, this isn't exactly true. The fact is, is that the British Museum had a complete specimen of a dodo in their collection up until the 18th century -- it was actually mummified, skin and all -- but in a fit of space-saving zeal, they actually cut off the head and they cut off the feet and they burned the rest in a bonfire. If you go look at their website today, they'll actually list these specimens, saying, the rest was lost in a fire.
The frontispiece of this article was this photo, and I'm one of the people that thinks that Tina Brown was great for bringing photos to the New Yorker, because this photo completely rocked my world. I became obsessed with the object -- not just the beautiful photograph itself, and the color, the shallow depth of field, the detail that's visible, the wire you can see on the beak there that the conservator used to put this skeleton together -- there's an entire story here. And I thought to myself, wouldn't it be great if I had my own dodo skeleton?
The key that the Marquis du Lafayette sent to George Washington to celebrate the storming of the Bastille. Russian nuclear launch key: The one on the top is the picture of the one I found on eBay; the one on the bottom is the one I made for myself, because I couldn't afford the one on eBay.
Storm trooper costumes.
Maps of Middle Earth -- that's one I hand-drew myself. There's the dodo skeleton folder. This folder has 17,000 photos -- over 20 gigabytes of information -- and it's growing constantly.
You give me a drawing, you give me a prop to replicate, you give me a crane, scaffolding, parts from "Star Wars" -- especially parts from "Star Wars" -- I can do this stuff all day long. It's exactly how I made my living for 15 years.
And TAP Plastics made me -- although I didn't photograph it -- a museum vitrine. I don't have the room for this in my house, but I had to finish what I had started. And this actually represented kind of a sea change to me.
And in this folder, "Creative Projects," there are tons of projects that I'm currently working on, projects that I've already worked on, things that I might want to work on some day, and things that I may just want to find and buy and have and look at and touch. But now there was potentially this new category of things that I could sculpt that was different, that I -- you know, I have my own R2D2, but that's -- honestly, relative to sculpting, to me, that's easy.
Now, this is funny for me: to fall in love with an object from a Hammett novel, because if it's true that the world is divided into two types of people,
Chandler people and Hammett people, I am absolutely a Chandler person.
But in this case, it's not about the author, it's not about the book or the movie or the story, it's about the object in and of itself. And in this case, this object is -- plays on a host of levels. First of all, there's the object in the world.
This is the "Kniphausen Hawk." It is a ceremonial pouring vessel made around 1700 for a Swedish Count, and it is very likely the object from which
Hammett drew his inspiration for the Maltese Falcon.
Then there is the fictional bird, the one that Hammett created for the book. Built out of words, it is the engine that drives the plot of his book and also the movie, in which another object is created: a prop that has to represent the thing that Hammett created out of words, inspired by the Kniphausen Hawk, and this represents the falcon in the movie.
And then there is this fourth level, which is a whole new object in the world: the prop made for the movie, the representative of the thing, becomes, in its own right, a whole other thing, a whole new object of desire. And so now it was time to do some research. I actually had done some research a few years before -- it's why the folder was there.
I'd bought a replica, a really crappy replica, of the Maltese Falcon on eBay, and had downloaded enough pictures to actually have some reasonable reference.
But I discovered, in researching further, really wanting precise reference, that one of the original lead birds had been sold at Christie's in 1994, and so I contacted an antiquarian bookseller who had the original Christie's catalogue, and in it I found this magnificent picture, which included a size reference. I was able to scan the picture, blow it up to exactly full size. I found other reference.
Chekmayan, a New Jersey editor, actually found this resin Maltese Falcon at a flea market in 1991, although it took him five years to authenticate this bird to the auctioneers' specifications, because there was a lot of controversy about it.
It was made out of resin, which wasn't a common material for movie props about the time the movie was made. It's funny to me that it took a while to authenticate it, because I can see it compared to this thing, and I can tell you -- it's real, it's the real thing, it's made from the exact same mold that this one is. In this one, because the auction was actually so controversial,
So now, I had all the topology I needed to replicate the Maltese Falcon. What do they do, how do you start something like that? I really don't know.
So I took Sculpey, and I built a big block of it, and I passed it through until, you know, I got the right profiles. And then slowly, feather by feather, detail by detail,
I worked out and achieved -- working in front of the television and Super Sculpey -- here's me sitting next to my wife -- it's the only picture I took of the entire process. As I moved through, I achieved a very reasonable facsimile of the Maltese Falcon. But again, I am not a sculptor, and so I don't know a lot of the tricks, like,
Now the original one, I should tell you, is sculpted by a guy named Fred Sexton. This is where it gets weird.
Fred Sexton was a friend of this guy, George Hodel.
Terrifying guy -- agreed by many to be the killer of the Black Dahlia.
Now, James Ellroy believes that Fred Sexton, the sculptor of the Maltese Falcon, killed James Elroy's mother.
In 1974, during the production of a weird comedy sequel to "The Maltese Falcon," called "The Black Bird," starring George Segal, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art had a plaster original of the Maltese Falcon -- one of the original six plasters, I think, made for the movie -- stolen out of the museum.
John's Grill, which actually is seen briefly in "The Maltese Falcon," is still a viable San Francisco eatery, counted amongst its regular customers Elisha Cook, who played Wilmer Cook in the movie, and he gave them one of his original plasters of the Maltese Falcon.
And they had it in their cabinet for about 15 years, until it got stolen in January of 2007. It would seem that the object of desire only comes into its own by disappearing repeatedly. So here I had this Falcon, and it was lovely.
It's a group of prop crazies just like me called the Replica Props Forum, and it's people who trade, make and travel in information about movie props. And it turned out that one of the guys there, a friend of mine that I never actually met, but befriended through some prop deals, was the manager of a local foundry. He took my master Falcon pattern, he actually did lost wax casting in bronze for me, and this is the bronze I got back.
We left off the last video at the end of 1789.
The Bastille had been stormed in July, as Parisians wanted to get the weapons from the Bastille, and free a few political prisoners to, in their minds, protect themselves from any tyranny from Louis XVl. Louis XVI had reluctantly kind of gone behind the scenes and said, "OK, National Assembly, I'm not going to get in your way anymore." Because he's seen the writing on the wall - that every time he's done something, it's only led to even more extreme counteraction.
And they were able to get their demands. It resulted in Louis XVI and wife, Marie-Antoinette, moving back to Paris, where they couldn't do things like hoard grain. And they'll be surrounded by all of the maybe not-so-friendly people who could watch what they're doing.
And they actually made their servants dress as nobility to make them the targets in case they were ambushed anyway on their way trying to escape from Paris. Dressed as servants, the King and Queen-- the King tried to escape to this general's estate. But when they were in Varennes, right here, they were actually spotted.
And the most revolutionary, the most radical elements, were called the Jacobins. And after the King and Queen tried to escape and came back, they were like hey, gee, what's the use of even having a king? You National Assembly, why are you even trying to write some type of constitution that gives any power whatsoever to a king?
Which is essentially-- there's a lot of kind of nuanced definitions of what a republic is, but the most simple one is it's a state without a king, without an emperor, without a queen. So they're saying, we don't need, you know-- you National Assembly, you think you're being radical.
And they actually started to organize in Paris. This right here is the Champ-de-Mars. I know I'm saying it completely wrong.
And so they started taking signatures in this kind of public park in Paris to essentially say, we don't need a king. We want to essentially create our own republic. That this National Assembly, they're not radical enough.
And so people started gathering over here in the Champ-de-Mars and things got a little ugly. So the actual troops were sent in to kind of calm everyone down.
And this was the massacre. Or the Champ-de-Mars Massacre. I know I'm saying it wrong.
They tried to run away. When the Jacobins, or in general kind of revolutionaries, but they're led by the Jacobins, when they start to suggest that, hey, we should have a republic. We shouldn't even have a king.
And that was Leopold Il. So Leopold II was the Holy Roman Emperor. But it's not like he was like the Roman Emperors of old.
But what was the most influential was the region that was under control of the Habsburgs of Austria, or Leopold Il. And not only was he in control, or not only did he have the title of Holy Roman Empire, and essentially had control of the Austrian, I guess you could say Empire, at that point in time.
He was also Marie-Antoinette's brother.
Leopold Il, that's her brother. So Leopold II and Frederick William II of Prussia, which is another mainly Germanic state. Let me do that in a better color.
They issued the Declaration of Pillnitz. Let me write this down. So this is going to add even more insult to injury to just the general population of France.
The Declaration of Pillnitz.
And this was done in August. so I just want to make it very clear what happened.
In June of 1791, they tried to escape, they were captured at Varennes. Then in July of 1791, you have the Champ-de-Mars Massacre. So already, people are very wary of the royals.
We've talked a lot about demand So now let's talk about supply! And we'll use grapes for this example
And so let's just say Scenario A If the price per pound of grapes is 50 cents if it's 50 cents per pound actually let me just do round numbers but you get the idea The price per pound is $1.
Now, let's take Scenario B Let's say the price goes up to $2 Well now not only would we produce what we were producing before, but we might now wanna buy some more land
Let's say Scenario D. the price goes to $4 a pound Same dynamic, I'll stop planting other crops. And use them now for grapes because grape prices are so high and so I will produce 2750 pounds
That's Scenario A. At $2 we would supply 2000 pounds.
That's Scenario B. At $3 we would supply 2500 pounds. $3....I am sorry.... See...notice I get my axes confused
And then Scenario D at $4 Actually let me be a little bit clearer with that because we're getting a little close This is 2500 pounds gets us right over here.
This is Scenario C.
And then Scenario D at $4-2750 So 2750 is like right over there So that is $4.
That is Scenario D. And if we connect them, they should all be on our supply curve. So they will all be... it would look something like that.
The writer George Eliot cautioned us that, among all forms of mistake, prophesy is the most gratuitous. The person that we would all acknowledge as her 20th-century counterpart, Yogi Berra, agreed. He said, "It's tough to make predictions, especially about the future."
"the new machine age." The thing to keep in mind is that this is absolutely great news. This is the best economic news on the planet these days.
The second reason that the new machine age is such great news is that, once the androids start doing jobs, we don't have to do them anymore, and we get freed up from drudgery and toil. Now, when I talk about this with my friends in Cambridge and Silicon Valley, they say,
"Fantastic. No more drudgery, no more toil. This gives us the chance to imagine an entirely different kind of society, a society where the creators and the discoverers and the performers and the innovators come together with their patrons and their financiers to talk about issues, entertain, enlighten, provoke each other."
It's a society really, that looks a lot like the TED Conference. And there's actually a huge amount of truth here. We are seeing an amazing flourishing taking place.
"Hey Walter, how are you going to get these robots to pay union dues?"
And Reuther shoots back, "Hey Henry, how are you going to get them to buy cars?" Reuther's problem in that anecdote is that it is tough to offer your labor to an economy that's full of machines, and we see this very clearly in the statistics. If you look over the past couple decades at the returns to capital -- in other words, corporate profits -- we see them going up, and we see that they're now at an all-time high.
Over this time frame, Ted has continued to hold a full-time job. Bill hasn't. In many cases, Bill has left the economy entirely, and Ted very rarely has.
Friedrich Hayek, Richard Nixon and Milton Friedman. And if you find yourself worried that something like a guaranteed income is going to stifle our drive to succeed and make us kind of complacent, you might be interested to know that social mobility, one of the things we really pride ourselves on in the United States, is now lower than it is in the northern European countries that have these very generous social safety nets. So the economic playbook is actually pretty straightforward.
like have our best economists and policymakers play "Jeopardy!" against Watson. We could send Congress on an autonomous car road trip. And if we do enough of these kinds of things, the awareness is going to sink in that things are going to be different.
Winston Churchill came to my home of MlT in 1949, and he said, "If we are to bring the broad masses of the people in every land to the table of abundance, it can only be by the tireless improvement of all of our means of technical production."
Abraham Lincoln realized there was one other ingredient. He said, "I am a firm believer in the people. If given the truth, they can be depended upon to meet any national crisis.
Toby is a farmer. He plants 12 rows of carrots in a field. Each row has six carrots.
Now there're twelve of these, he plants twelve rows of carrots. (Let me see if I can copy and paste this.) (So... copy and paste.) So that's two rows... (I want to make sure I have enough space.) Two rows.
How many carrots did Toby plant? Well you could do this exercise and then try to count all of these carrots but that seems a little bit crazy. These are already a lot of carrots and especially if there were even larger numbers, it would take you forever to count it!
Where we left off in the last video, Napoleon was doing pretty well. In 1804, just as a bit of review, he declared himself Emperor Napoleon I.
- which was mainly made up of Russia and Austria. And this is all review. We saw this in the last video.
"Gee, this Napoleon guy, he's pretty formidable." is that it ended the Holy Roman Empire, which you remember was neither holy, nor Roman, nor an empire. It was really just a collection of German speaking states.
But it was originally built by Napoleon, to - or it was commissioned by Napoleon - to celebrate his victory at Austerlitz. So this is the Arc de - (My spelling is always a little weak. But it's especially weak when
Arc de Triomphe. And that's right there. So Napoleon was doing pretty well.
Frederick Wilhelm ill.
It actually took me a long time to realize that Wilhelm and William are the same names.
And William is just the English version of it. But this is Frederick Wilhelm ill and he is the King of Prussia. And he stayed out of the action during the Third Coalition.
So Frederick Wilhelm ill declares war. We're now in 1806. So we are now in 1806..
So this is actually Napoleon getting the troops together at Jena-Auerstedt. This right here is a charge of the French troops there. Let me write this down.
let me get the spelling right, E-Y-L-A-U. Super bloody. They actually win the battle.
But Napoleon persists, and he's eventually able to decisively meet the Russians at Friedland, which is right about there. This is Friedland right there. That is in June of 1807.
We're talking about June is when Friedland occurs, Russians decisively defeated. The Prussians were already trounced several months ago.
The Treaties of Tilsit.
And it's called the Treaties of Tilsit, instead of the Treaty of Tilsit, because he signed separate treaties with Russia and Prussia. At this point, Napoleon had kind of lost all respect for Prussia.
This is Alexander I And as you'll see, this friendship is very temporary.
As you could imagine, I mean this is the guy Napoleon defeated at Austerlitz not too long ago. So you know, all this friendship should probably be written in quotes. But the treaty with Russia was very friendly.
The main thing it did, it took the territory west of the river Elbe from Prussia.
So this is the river Elbe right here. That right there is the river Elbe. The blue is Prussia after the Third Coalition.
And most of it turns into a French satellite kingdom called the Kingdom of Westphalia. So this is part of the Prussian Treaty of Tilsit.
So you have the Kingdom of Westphalia. Kingdom of Westphalia And to really emphasize, it really is a French satellite state.
He got them, through the Treaty of Tilsit, to also join the Continental System. Let me write that in a color that'll actually show up. Join the Continental System.
And Russia in return, and it's pretty good because Russia essentially lost the war, but in return they were allowed to do whatever they want with the Ottoman Empire.
And we'll talk more about the Ottoman Empire in future videos, but if you want to have a general view of what the Ottoman Empire is,
I guess the last remnant of it is what is today modern Turkey. But obviously it was an empire at that time. But Russia and the Ottoman Empire were kind of that at odds with each other.
So it was great for Russia to say hey, I'm going to be able to do whatever I want with the Ottoman Empire. Because before this, Napoleon was nominally aligned with the Ottomans.
So this was actually a big concession for Russia. So at the end of this, we have a situation once again, I guess the other powers don't realize it.
Puts his brother as king in the kingdom of Westphalia. And now he has Russia as an ally to help his embargo on England. So really, after the end of the Fourth Coalition, a lot of historians view this as kind of the height of Napoleon's power in Europe.
Your car gets 25 miles per gallon, per gallon and you want to go on a 400 mile road trip. Right now, gas costs $3 per gallon. How much will the gas for your road trip cost?
the gallons per mile, the gallons per mile. And what are the gallons per mile? Well, we have 25 miles per gallon.
Hi, I'm John Green; this is Crash Course: World History and today we're going to talk about Russia, which means we get to talk about this guy again! We haven't talked about Russia much so far because 1.
Mr. Green, Mr. Green!
Why'd you take Russian? Well, because I had this big crush on a Russian major. But, anyway,
[music intro]
[music intro]
[music intro]
[music intro]
[music intro]
So, today we're going to talk about persistent stereotypes about Russia, and how Russia came to take its current shape, a turn of events we owe largely to the Mongols.
[Savage, brassy swarm of Mongol-tage doom calls...] But before we discuss the Mongol conquest of Russia, let's discuss exactly what got conquered.
Most historians now believe that the settlers of Kiev were Slavic people who migrated from around the Black Sea. But there's an older theory that the settlers of Kiev were actually,
like, Vikings. That theory goes that Vikings came down to Kiev from rivers like the Dnieper and founded a trading outpost similar to ones they'd founded in Iceland and Greenland.
Which is an awesome idea and everything, but Russian, the language that developed from what the Rus spoke, sounds a lot more Slavic than it sounds, you know, Swedish. To illustrate, here is a Swede fighting with a Russian over who founded Kiev. [Russian:
[Swede: No. Clearly Kiev was founded by Swedes.]
Right, okay, so trade was hugely important to Kiev. Almost all of their wars ended with trade concession treaties, and their law codes were unusually devoted to the subject of commerce. The Rus traded raw materials like fur, wax, and also slaves—
We're not gonna venture into the astonishingly intense etymological debate over whether the word slav derives from the Latin word for slave because there's nothing more terrifying and verbose than an etymologist flame war. But, yeah, the Rus traded slaves. They also relied on agriculture— and your relationships to the land determined both your social status and your tax burden.
Couple more things about Kiev: First, the ruler of Kiev was called the Grand Prince, and he became the model for future Russian Kings.
"Drink is the joy of the Russian."
Anyway, the Kievan Rus eventually fell in 1240 when these guys
[Mongol-tage horns horn it up] showed up and replaced them. By that time the Rus had been at war with pastoral nomads for centuries; from the Khazars to the Pechengs to the Cumans, and they were tired.
The period of Mongol "rule" over Russia is also known as Appanage Russia.
An Appanage is princedom, and this period basically featured a bunch of Russian princes vying for control over territory, which is not a recipe for political stability or economic growth, another theme that will re-emerge in Russian history. By the way, I'm describing all of this as Russia even though if you did that in the 13th century, people would look at you funny.
The Mongols did set up the Khanate o f the Golden Horde in Russia, but it didn't leave much lasting impact on the institutions of the region, which had already been set up by the Kievans.
But they did bring about a population shift— away from the South, where Kiev was, toward the Northeast.
They were happy to live in their yurts and collect tribute from the ever-bickering Russian princes. And all the princes had to do in exchange for their relative freedom was recognize the Mongol khans as their rulers and allow the Mongols to pick the Grand Prince from among the Russians. Perhaps most importantly,
Mongol rule cut the Russians off from the Byzantines and further isolated them from Europe, leaving Russia not Byzantine, not European, and not really Mongol either, since they hated the Mongols and generally believed the Mongols were a scourge sent from
God to punish them for their sinfulness and everything. But the Mongols did help propel Moscow to prominence and in doing so, created the idea that this was Russia. And as an aside, they also did what
The Mongols successfully conquered Russia in the winter. Thanks, Thought Bubble. So how did the Mongols help catapult Moscow and its princes to prominence?
Well, first, they named Muscovite princes The Grand Prince on more than one occasion. More importantly, the Muscovite princes won— that is to say purchased— the right to collect tribute on behalf of the Khan from other princes. That's a good gig because it's easy to skim a little bit off the top before you send it down the line to
[Mongol-taging a bit more for good measure] the Mongols. Which is precisely what the Muscovites did to enrich themselves— in fact, one prince who was particularly good at this was known as Ivan Kalita.
Using my Russian, I can tell you that that translates to
"Johnny Moneybags." As my Russian professor would tell you, I'm a "creative" translator.
The Mongols also helped them more directly by attacking their enemies. Plus Moscow was at the headwaters of four rivers which made it well-positioned for trade. And because they were kind of the allies of the Mongols- the Mongols rarely attacked them- which meant that lots of people went to Moscow because it was relatively safe.
As the Mongols" position weakened in Russia in the latter half of the 14th century, one of Moscow's princes Dmitrii Donskoi made war on them and inflicted the first major defeat of Mongols in Russia at battle of Kulikovo Field. This showed that the Mongols weren't invincible, which is always really bad for an imperial force. Plus it made Moscow look like the hero of the Russians.
[Swoodilyscoots by globey to get his fireside chat on]
An Open Letter to Basil and Basil: But first, let's see in the Secret Compartment.
Basil Il, the eventual winner of the civil war, had Basil the cross-eyed blinded. Because being cross-eyed wan't bad enough. And that was seen as the end of the political career of
But then Basil the Cross-Eyed's brother tracked down Basil II and he was like
"I'ma blind you back!"
And of course, everybody thought that would end Basil Il's political career, but they were wrong. It turns out you can rule Russia like a Boss even if you're blind. Best Wishes, Johnny Bookwriter
Ivan ill, later known as Ivan the Great.
First, he asserted Russian independence from the Mongols and stopped paying tribute to the khan-- after the khan had named him Grand Prince, of course. Then,
Ivan purchased, negotiated for or conquered multiple appanages, thus expanding Muscovite power even more.
Ivan later declared himself sovereign of all Russians and then married the niece of the last Byzantine emperor, thus giving him even more legitimacy. And he took titles autocrat and tsar, which means Caesar. Basically,
Ivan created the first centralized Russian state and for doing that he probably deserves title "the Great." And that would be a good place to stop, except then we won't see the type of absolute rule that characterized Russia for most of the rest of its history, even unto Putin.
OH GOD. JUST KlDDlNG PUTlN! YOU'D NEVER RlG AN ELECTlON..
While Ivan ill consolidated Muscovite power, the undeniable brutal streak in Russian governance comes not from the Mogols, but from Ivan IV.
Ivan IV ruled from 1533 to 1584, taking the throne at age 16, yet more evidence that adolescents should not be trusted with emerging empires.
Ivan the Terrible's reign represents the end of princely power and the beginning of the autocracy that Russia is famous for. But in the beginning, he was really an innovative leader. As a young king, he worked with a group of advisers called the Chosen Council, which certainly sounds like a good thing.
Ivan earned his nickname, the Terrible— which can mean either bad or just awe-inspiring, depending on your perspective. Psychological historians will point out that things started go terribly wrong with Ivan after the death of his beloved wife, Anastasia Romanov. Or they might point to the fact that he enjoyed torturing animals when he was a kid.
Ivan set out to break the power of the nobility-- the former princes and landowners called the boyars. They were the last link to princely rule. And after an odd episode that saw him briefly "abdicate,"
Ivan returned to Moscow and declared he had the right to punish all traitors and evildoers. To help him in this effort,
Ivan created the oprichnikii a corps of secret police who rode around on black horses, wearing all black, whose job it was to hunt down and destroy any enemies of the tsar.
See also: Nazgul and Dementors. So this was the first of Russia's purges.
And over the latter half of Ivan's reign, whole towns were destroyed. It was, in effect, a civil war, except with no resistance. One historian called it a civil massacre.
Ivan IV established absolute control of the tsar over all the Russian people, but he also set the precedent of accomplishing this through terror, secret police, and the suspension of law. And that would echo through the ages of Russian history...
I mean, until Vladimir Putin heroically put an end to it. His little eyes. They're scary...
Find the slope of a line perpendicular to the line 3x plus 2y is equal to 6. So if I have one line-- so let me draw some quick axes here. So that's my y-axis, and that is my x-axis.
I have this problem here from chapter five of the Kotz, Treichel, and Townsend Chemistry and Chemical Reactivity book, and I'm doing this with their permission.
Let's try to evaluate seven and six-ninths minus three and two-fifths. So like always I like to separate out the whole number parts from the fractional parts. This is the same thing as seven plus six-ninths minus three minus two-fifth.
감사합니다.

John: Hi, there. My name's John Green.
This is Crash Course World History, and today we're gonna talk about the fall of Rome.
Mr. Green, Mr. Green, Mr. Green, who's that pretty lady?
How and when Rome fell remains the subject of considerable historical debate, but today I'm going to argue that Rome didn't really fall until the middle of the 15th century. But first, let me introduce you to the traditional view "Barbarians at the Gates." My, don't you look traditional.
I wanna be really technical about it, the city of Rome was conquered by bar, bar, bar, bar, bar, barbarians in 476 CE. There was a last Roman emperor, Romulus Augustus, who ruled the empire for less than a year before being deposed and sent into exile by Odoacer, who was some kind of barbarian, we don't know for sure,
Ostragoth, Han, Visigoth, [Vados], they all looked the same to the Romans. Rome had been sacked by barbarians before, most notably by Alaric the Visigoth in 410. Is it Alaric or Aleric?
The dictionary says Aleric, but the "Vampire Diaries" say Alaric, so I'm gonna go with Alaric. But anyway, after 476 CE, there was never again a Roman emperor in Rome. Then there's the hipper anti-imperialistic argument.
Rome was doomed to fall as soon as it spread outside of Italy because the further the territory is from the capitol, the harder it is to govern; thus, imperialism itself sowed the seeds of destruction in Rome. This was the argument put forth by the Roman historian Tacitus, although he put it in the mouth of a British chieftain.
That sounded dirty, but it's not. It's all about context here on Crash Course. "To robbery, slaughter, plunder, they give the lying name of empire;
In Rome's case, to make them Romans. This worked really well in the early days of the Roman Republic, and even at the beginning of the empire, but it eventually led to barbarians inside the gates. The decline of the Roman legion started
long before Rome started getting sacked. It really began with the extremely bad decision to incorporate Germanic warriors into the Roman army.
Rome had a long history of absorbing people from the empire's fringes into the polity, first by making them allies, and then eventually by granting them full citizenship rights. But usually these foreign citizens had developed ties to Rome itself; they learned Latin, they bought into the whole idea of the aristocratic republic.
By the 3rd and 4th centuries CE, though, the empire had been forced to allow the kind of riff-raff into their army who didn't really care about the idea of Rome itself, they were only loyal to their commanders.
As you, no doubt, remember from the historical examples of Caesar, Pompey, Marius, contemporary Afghanistan, this is not a recipe for domestic bliss.
So, here was Rome stuck with a bunch of expensive and bloody wars against Germanic peoples who were really good at fighting, and then they had a great idea: Why not fight with these guys?
So, they essentially hired them, and soon the Roman legions were teaming with these mercenaries who were loyal mostly to gold, secondarily to their commanders, and not at all to Rome, which was a place that very few of them ever even saw. Why would they even give a crap about the health and well-being of the Roman Empire?
Am I allowed to say crap, Stan?
(ding, ding, ding, ding, ding) Nlce! This was of course a recipe for civil war, and that's exactly what happened with general, after general, after general declaring himself emperor of Rome; so, there was very little stability in the West. For instance, between 235 and 284 CE, 41 different people were either emperor or claimed to be emperor.
Really? Oldsmobile isn't a company anymore?
And Byzantium is a place? Are you sure? So, remember when I said the Roman Empire survived 'til the 15th century?
Well, that was the Eastern Roman Empire, commonly known as the Byzantine Empire, although, not by the people who lived in it, who identified themselves as Romans.
So, while the Western Roman Empire descended into chaos, the eastern half of the empire had its capitol in Byzantium, a city on the Bosphorus Strait that Constantine would later remane
Constantinople, thereby paving the way for They Might Be Giants' only mainstream hit.
Constantine moved his headquarters, and thereby, the headquarters of the Roman Empire to Constantinople in 324 CE.
Constantine had lots of reasons to move his capitol east. For one thing, he probably spoke better Greek than Latin, and plus, the eastern provinces were a lot richer than the western provinces, and from a [wooting] perspective, you just want to be closer to where the good warring is.
The enemy is in the East, like the Persian Parthians, and the Persian Sasanians were real empires, not just bands of warriors; and no matter who you were in world history, if you wanted to make a name for yourself in terms of war, you really needed to be up against the Persians, even if you were the Mongols.
Not this time, friends. (classic movie audio) As the political center of the Roman Empire shifted east,
Constantine also tried to reorient his new religion, Christianity, toward the east, holding the first church council in Nicaea in 325. The idea was to get all Christians to believe the same thing; that worked, but it did mark the beginning of the emperor having greater control over the church.
That trend would, of course, later lead to tensions between the church centered in Constantinople and the one centered in Rome, but more on that in a bit.
To give you a sense of how dramatic this shift was, by the 4th century CE, Constantinople's population had soared while Rome's had gone from 500,000 to 80,000; and although the Byzantines spoke Greek, not Latin, they considered themselves Romans, and if they did, we probably should, too.
Let's go to the thought bubble. There is a lot of continuity between the old Western Roman Empire and the new Eastern one. Politically, each was ruled by a single man, sometimes there were two, and once there were four, but let's forget about that for now, who wielded absolute military power.
War was pretty much constant as the Byzantines fought the Persian Sasanian Empire, and then various Islamic empires. Trade and valuable agricultural land that yielded high taxes meant that the Byzantine Empire was, like the Western Roman Empire, exceptionally rich, and it was slightly more compact as a territory than its predecessor, and much more urban, containing, as it did, all of those once independent Greek city-states, which made it easier to administer.
Also, like their western counterparts, the Byzantines enjoyed spectacle and sport.
Chariot races in Constantinople were huge, with thousands turning out at the Hippodrome to cheer on their favorites, big bets were placed, and there was a huge rivalry, not just about sports, but also about political affiliations between the two main teams, the blues and the greens. Thanks for putting us on the greens, thought bubble. That rivalry was so heated that riots often broke out between them, and in one such riot, an estimated 30,000 people were killed.
But, perhaps the most consistently Roman aspect of Byzantine society was that they followed Roman law. The Romans always prided themselves on being ruled by laws, not by men, and even though that wasn't actually the case after the 2nd century BCE, there's no question that the Eastern Roman Empire's codification of Roman laws was one of its great achievements, and much of the credit for that goes to the most famous Byzantine Emperor, at least after Constantine, Justinian.
I like your broach, sir. In 533, Justinian published the Digest, an 800,000 word condensation of 1,528 Latin law books; and to go along with this, he published the Institutes, which was like a curriculum for the Roman law schools hat existed all through the Empire.
Justinian, incidentally, was by far the most awesome of the Byzantine emperors, he was like the David Tennant of doctors. He was born a peasant somewhere in the Balkans, and then rose to become Emperor in 527. He ruled for almost 30 years, and in addition to codifying Roman law he did a lot to restore the former glory of the Roman Empire.
He took Carthage back, he even took Rome back from the Goths, although not for long, and he's responsible for the building of one of the great churches of all time, the Hagia Sophia, or Church of Saint Wisdom. So, after one of those sporting riots destroyed the previous church, he built this, which with its soaring domes, became a symbol for the wealth and opulence of his empire. The Romans were remarkable builders and engineers, and the Hagia Sophia is no exception.
A dome its equal wouldn't be built for another 500 years, so you'd never mistake it for a Roman temple, it doesn't have the austerity or the emphasis on engineering that you see in, for instance, the Colosseum; and this building, in many ways, functions as a symbol for the ways in which the Eastern Roman Empire was both Roman and not. But maybe the most interesting thing that Justinian ever did was to be married to his controversial theater person of a wife, Theodora.
Hey, Danika, can we get Theodora up here? (ding) Wow, that is perfect. It's funny how married couples always look like each other.
Theodora began her career as an actress, dancer, and possible prostitute before becoming Empress, and she may have saved her husband's rule by convincing him not to flea the city during riots between the blues and the greens. She also mentored a eunuch, who went on to become a hugely important general. Mentoring a eunuch sounds like a euphemism, but it's not.
So, in short, the Byzantines continued the Roman legacy of empire, and war, and law for almost 1,000 years after Romulus Augustus was driven out of Rome.
The Byzantines may not has spoken Latin, and few of their emperors came from Rome, but in most important ways, they were Romans, except one really important way. The Byzantines followed a different form of Christianity, the branch we now call Eastern, or sometimes, Greek Orthodox.
How there came to be a split between the Catholic and Orthodox traditions is complicated, you might even call it Byzantine.
What matters for us are the differences between the churches, the main doctrinal one being about the dating of Easter and the main political one being about who rules whom. Did I get my whom right there, Stan?
(ding, ding, ding, ding, ding) Yes! In the West, there was a pope, and in the East there was a patriarch.
The pope is the head of the Roman Catholic church, he sort of serves as God's regent on earth and he doesn't answer to any secular ruler, and ever since the fall of Rome there has been a lot of tension in Western Europe between popes and kings over who should have the real power.
But in the Orthodox church, they didn't have that problem, because the patriarch was always appointed by the emperor, so it was pretty clear who had control over the church, so much that they even had a word for it,
Caesaropapism, Caesar over pope. But the fact that in Rome there was no emperor after 476 meant there was no one to challenge the pope, which would profoundly shape European history over the next 1,200 years. So, I would argue that in some important ways, the Roman Empire survived for 1,000 years after it left Rome, but in some ways it still survives today.
I'd like to dedicate this next song to Carmelo, who was put to sleep a couple of days ago, because he got too old. But apparently he was a very nice dog and he always let the cat sleep in the dog bed.

Let's say I am an economist, and I am curious about whether, in general, things are getting more expensive or not, and if they are getting expensive, by how much?
"on average are spent on housing;
"maybe another 10% is spent on transportation;
"maybe another 10% is spent on food," and I would go out into the market, and I would try to take an average of what these things cost, and I would sample a bunch of products, a bunch of services, so I could get a decent average of that. This is not a simple thing to do, but I am an economist, and I am serious about trying to calculate it. Let's say that when I take that weighted average of all of the stuff, I just come up with a number.
"Hey; I could sell you this house," so this is in year 5,
"I could sell you a house,
"and this house in year 5 is $660,000." Is $660,000. Someone might ask, what would be that price if we adjusted it for inflation in year 1 dollars?
"adjusted for inflation in year 1 money?" you're essentially saying,
"What amount of money would that house
"have had to cost in year 1,
"that when you adjust it for inflation,
"when you increase it by 10%," so that's the same thing; increasing by 10% is the same thing as multiplying by 110%, or multiplying by 1.1, so, "what amount of money would that house
"had to have cost in year 1,
"that if I multiply it by 1.1,
"I get $660,000?" We could do a little bit of quick math here, to figure that out. If we say, let's say that, I don't know,
P is the price of the house in year 1. I'll call it P1.
That x 1.1 ... x 1.1 is going to be equal to $660,000, when you factor in the 10% inflation over these years. This is simple algebra right here. You can divide both sides by 1.1.
You could work it out with a calculator, if you don't feel comfortable with what I'm about to do, but this would give you $600,000, if you work this math right out here, and you could figure out the decimals. What we could do ... I think you get the general idea here.
"This house in year 5 is $660,000,
"which is equal to $600,000 in year 1 money." As an example of that, I live in a neighborhood where the houses have gotten all of a sudden, because I live in the heart of Silicon Valley, it's not a fancy neighborhood by any stretch of the imagination, but the houses now are quite expensive, and we have neighbors who moved in in the '50s, and they say, "My God; I bought our house
"for $10,000, and now people
"are selling these houses for so much more." The reality is, is that it is true; the house has appreciated, but $10,000 in 1950 was actually a lot, a lot, of money. Doctors and engineers did not make that much more than that much per year.
Ron and Hermione are practising lifting feathers into the air with magic. Hermione can lift a feather 35 feet into the air which is 5 times as high Ron can lift a feather. How high can Ron lift a feather with his magic?
I'm going to ask you to raise your arms and wave back, just the way I am -- kind of a royal wave.
We will be able to fly into the anatomy of Peter's brain -- literally, fly into his body -- but more importantly, we can look into his mind.
When Peter moves his arm, that yellow spot you see there is the interface to the functioning of Peter's mind taking place. Now you've seen before that with electrodes you can control robotic arms, that brain imaging and scanners can show you the insides of brains. What's new is that that process has typically taken days or months of analysis.
We've collapsed that through technology to milliseconds, and that allows us to let Peter to look at his brain in real time as he's inside the scanner. He can look at these 65,000 points of activation per second. If he can see this pattern in his own brain, he can learn how to control it.
My wife and I have recently purchased an assortment pack of soap, and we both want to experience all 3 bars. And we are not willing to share soap with each other. So we have a little bit of a conundrum.
In my humble opinion, the single most important biochemical reaction, especially to us, is cellular respiration. And the reason why I feel so strongly about that is because this is how we derive energy from what we eat, or from our fuel. Or if we want to be specific, from glucose.
ATP is the energy currency for biological systems. And so you might say hey, well it looks like glucose is the energy currency for biological systems. And to some degree, both answers would be correct.
It's really the process of taking glucose and producing ATPs, with maybe heat as a byproduct. But it's probably nice to have that heat around. We need to be reasonably warm in order for our cells to operate correctly.
-- to 38 ATPs. And the reality is, this is in the ideal circumstances that you'll produce 38 ATPs.
I was reading up a little bit before doing this video. And the reality is, depending on the efficiency of the cell in performing cellular respiration, it'll probably be more on the order of 29 to 30 ATPs. But there's a huge variation here and people are really still studying this idea.
And just so you know, this part, the glyco for glucose and then lysis means to break up. When you saw hydrolysis, it means using water to break up a molecule. Glycolysis means we're going to be breaking up glucose.
But glycolysis, it by itself generates-- well, it needs two ATPs. And it generates four ATPs. So on a net basis, it generates two
--it generates two net ATPs. So that's the first stage. And this can occur completely in the absence of oxygen.
--we're using the same colors too much
-- you have something called the electron transport chain.
And this part gets credit for producing the bulk of the ATPs.
34 ATPs. And this is also aerobic. It requires oxygen.
If we have oxygen we can move to the Krebs cycle, get our two ATPs, and then go on to the electron transport chain and produce 34 ATPs, which is really the bulk of what happens in respiration. Now I said this as an aside, that to some degree this isn't fair. Because while these guys are operating they're also producing these other molecules.
-- I'll write it as NAD plus
-- and we're adding hydrogens to it to form NADH. And this actually happens for one molecule of glucose, this happens to 10 NADs.
Or 10 NAD plusses to become NADHs. And those are actually what drive the electron transport chain. And I'll talk a lot more about it and kind of how that happens and why is energy being derived and how is this an oxidative reaction and all of that.
FAD, which is very similar. But they're producing FADH. Now I know all of this is very complicated.
But 38 ATPs, and it does it through three stages. The first stage is glycolysis, where you're just literally splitting the glucose into two. You're generating some ATPs.
But the more important thing is, you're generating some NADHs that are going to be used later in the electron transport chain. Then those byproducts are split even more in the Krebs cycle, directly producing two ATPs. But that produces a lot more NADHs.
We're told that Imran is two years older than Diya. Diya is 2. How old is Imran?
So here we're told that the giraffe at the zoo is 3 times taller than Shantanu.
Shantanu is 6 feet tall. How tall is the giraffe? So once again, I encourage you to pause this video and try to think about it on your own.
Let's use some letters to represent the different heights, so G for giraffe and S for Shantanu. I'll use G for the height of the giraffe. The height of the giraffe is 3 times taller-- not 3 more feet-- 3 times taller than Shantanu's height.
So we could say that the giraffe's height is equal to 3 times Shantanu's height. So let's be clear.
G represents the height of the giraffe,
S represents the height of Shantanu. So another way of thinking about it-- let me see if I can draw a giraffe reasonably here.
So Shantanu might look something like this. And if you took 3 times his height, so this is 1 time his height, 2 times his height, 3 times his height, you would get to the height of the giraffe. So that's what this first sentence tells us.
Shantanu is 6 feet tall. So they tell us that this height right over here is 6 feet. Or another way of saying it is S is equal to 6 feet.
I speak seven languages. As soon as people find out about that, what I'm most often asked -- other than for my phone number -- is:
"How did you do it? How did you go about learning all these different languages?" Well, today I'm going to share with you some answers.
And relax. And the reason for it is because our entire lives, we're taught how to do things right. From the moment we were born we're taught what things we should do, things we shouldn't do, and how to do things properly.
So, for the first technique, allow yourself to make that mistake, so that sounds like "Puerta" can come out. And now let's go to the second one. For the second one,
(Audience) Mao. (Sid) "Mao," perfect. The second one: one, two, three.
It's like "ouch", but without the "ch" sound, so it's "ou." One, two, three, (Audience) OU. (Sid) Perfect. So, "HE."
And sticklers could be your teacher, it could be your tutor, friend, it could be someone on Skype or on Craigslist; it doesn't matter. You can find sticklers all over the place, and with technology, it becomes a lot easier find them. And then it's time to practice.
Michael Phelps is known to visualize every single one of his races, several times over, before jumping in water. Worked great for him, and it works great for me, too, so it would work for you as well. And now let's go to using the language.
A candy machine creates small chocolate wafers in the shape of circular discs. The Diameter of each wafer is 16 millimeters. Whats it the area of each candy?
They gave us the diameter, what is the radius? well, you might remember that the radius is half of the diameter. Distance from the center of the circle to the outside, to the boundary of the circle.So, it will be this distance over here, which is exactly half of the diameter. So, would be 8 millimeters.
So, where we see the radius, we can put 8milimeters. So, the Area is going to be equal to pi times 8 millimeters square, which would be 64 pie millimeters square. And, typically this is written as pi after 64.
This circle is divised into equal parts. And we can see here divised into 1,2,3,4,5,6 equal parts. And they say what fraction of the circunference.
So the circunference is the length around the circle You can refer as the perimeter of the circle What fraction of the circunference of the circle is highlighted in pink?
We're asked what is the equation of line B? And they tell us that line A has an equation y is equal to 2x plus 11.
And they say that the line B contains the point 6, negative 7. And they tell us lines A and B are perpendicular, so that means that slope of B must be negative inverse of slope of A.
So what we'll do is figure out the slope of A, then take the negative inverse of it. Then we'll know the slope of B, then we can use this point right here to fill in the gaps and figure out B's y-intercept. So what's the slope of A?
The slope of A is right there, it's the 2, mx plus b. So the slope here is equal to 2. So the slope of A is 2.
What is the slope of B? So what is B's slope going to have to be? Well, it's perpendicular to A, so it's going to be the negative inverse of this.
We know that y is equal to negative 7 when x is equal to 6. Negative 1/2 times 6 plus b, right? I just know that this is on the point, so this point must satisfy the equation of line B.
So let's work out what b must be-- or what b, the y-intercept, this is a lowercase b, not the line B. So we have negative 7 is equal to-- what's negative 1/2 half times 6? That's not a b there, that's a 6.
I get that all the time in Dubai, "Here on holiday are you dear?" (Laughter)
"Come to visit the children?"
(Laughter)
"How long are you staying?" Well, actually I hope for a while longer yet. I have been living and teaching in the Gulf for over 30 years (Cheers) (Applause) and in that time I have seen a lot of changes.
This is the major change that I have seen: how teaching English has morphed from being a mutually beneficial practice to becoming a massive international business that it is today. No longer just a foreign language on the school curriculum, and no longer the sole domain of mother England. It has become a bandwagon for every English-speaking nation on Earth.
The best education, according to the latest world university rankings, is to be found in the universities of the UK and the US. So, everybody wants to have an English education, naturally. But if you are not a native speaker, you have to pass a test.
"What about the research? It's all in English." The books are in English, the journals are in English, but that is a self-fulfilling prophecy.
And I want to remind you that the giants upon whose shoulders today's intelligentsia stand, did not have to have English, — they didn't have to pass an English test — case in point, Einstein. He, by the way, was considered remedial at school, because he was in fact dyslexic.
But fortunately for the world, he did not have to pass an English test because they didn't start until 1964 with TOEFL, the American test of English. Now it's exploded. There are lots and lots of tests of English, and millions and millions of students do take these tests every year.
"Education: The Great Divide." I get it, I understand why people would want to focus on English.
So, he invented a cost-free solar lamp, and now, the children in his village get the same grades at school as the children who have electricity at home. (Applause)
When he received his award, he said these lovely words: "The children can lead Africa from what it is today, a dark continent, to a light continent." A simple idea, but it could have such far-reaching consequences.
(Applause)

 Rewrite the expression 4 times, and then in parentheses we have 8 plus 3, using the distributive law of multiplication over addition. Then simplify the expression.
You have to distribute the 4. You have to multiply it times the 8 and times the 3. This is right here.
Four times, right? Let me go back to the drawing tool. We have it one, two, three, four times this expression, which is 8 plus 3.
How does the news shape the way we see the world? Here's the world based on the way it looks -- based on landmass. And here's how news shapes what Americans see.
This story eclipsed every country except Iraq, and received 10 times the coverage of the IPCC report. And the cycle continues; as we all know, Britney has loomed pretty large lately. So, why don't we hear more about the world?
Similarly, a study in e-content showed that much of global news from U.S. news creators is recycled stories from the AP wire services and Reuters, and don't put things into a context that people can understand their connection to it. So, if you put it all together, this could help explain why today's college graduates, as well as less educated Americans, know less about the world than their counterparts did 20 years ago. And if you think it's simply because we are not interested, you would be wrong.
 Add. Simplify the answer and write as a mixed number.
So in a normal economy We know that employment will drive overall demand if we have high employment or low unemployment then people are going to have more jobs and they're going to have higher wages and that will have higher demand or if the other way goes around if they lose their jobs demand is going to go down wages will start to go down and people aren't going to have money in their pockets. So that employment drives demand, and we can view demand and I'm making a huge simplification here demand will drive production or maybe we can think of it as supply it will drive supply and it can also be a driver of price.
And we could keep adding more lines here but this is a roughly simple take on it but the general idea is supply and price will then drive corporate profits, or just profits in general even for an individual business owner and then profits are going to drive employment Now, let's imagine a scenario we are in a bad economy maybe a depression-like economy. So that situation you could start really at any point in the circle
"Look, I have this dollar in my pocket I'm not going to spend this dollar because one, I might lose my job at any moment or, and I know that dollar is becoming more powerful I can buy more every minute that I wait."
Welcome to my presentation on domain of a function. So what's is the domain?
The domain of a function, you'll often hear it combined with domain and range. But the domain of a function is just what values can I put into a function and get a valid output. So let's start with something examples.
So here I'll say that the domain is the set of x's such that x is a member of the real numbers. So this is just a fancy way of saying that OK, this r with this kind of double backbone here, that just means real numbers, and I think you're familiar with real numbers now. That's pretty much every number outside of the complex numbers.
So here we say the domain is equal to -- do little brackets, that shows kind of the set of what x's apply. That's those little curly brackets, I didn't draw it that well. x is a member of the real numbers still, such that x does not equal 0. So here I just made a slight variation on what I had before.
It has to be further in the negative direction than negative 3, or it has to be further in the positive direction than positive 3. So, once again, x has to be less than negative 3 or x has to be greater than 3, so we have our domain. So we have it as x is a member of the reals
(Laughter) I was afraid of womanhood. Not that I'm not afraid now, but I've learned to pretend.
I grew up not far from here in Washington D.C. during the Civil Rights movement, the assassinations, the Watergate hearings and then the feminist movement, and I think I was drawing, trying to figure out what was going on. And then also my family was in chaos, and I drew to try to bring my family together -- (Laughter) -- try to bring my family together with laughter.
And then I thought -- in my 40s I started thinking, "Well, why don't I do something? I always loved political cartoons, so why don't I do something with the content of my cartoons to make people think about the stupid rules that we're following as well as laugh?"
My work also has allowed me to collaborate with women cartoonists from across the world -- countries such as Saudi Arabia,
Iran, Turkey, Argentina, France -- and we have sat together and laughed and talked and shared our difficulties. And these women are working so hard to get their voices heard in some very difficult circumstances.
By this point in the biology playlist, you're probably wondering a very natural question, how is gender determined in an organism? And it's not an obvious answer, because throughout the animal kingdom, it's actually determined in different ways. In some creatures, especially some types of reptiles, it's environmental.
So let me draw a nucleus. That's going to be my nucleus. And this is going to be the nucleus for a man.
And the blue one right there, we refer to that as the y chromosome. And to figure out whether something is a male or a female, it's a pretty simple system. If you've got a y chromosome, you are a male.
SRY, that plays a role in the development of testes or the male sexual organ. So if you have this around, this gene right here can start coding for things that will eventually lead to the development of the testicles. And if you don't have that around, that won't happen, so you'll end up with a female.
Actually, there's several types of hemophilia. But hemophilia is an inability for your blood to clot properly. And both of these are mutations on the X chromosome.
She has one regular X chromosome and then she has one X chromosome that has the-- I'll put a little superscript there for hemophilia-- she has the hemophilia mutation. She's just going to be a carrier. Her phenotype right here is going to be no hemophilia.
So for a man to exhibit hemophilia, to have this phenotype, he just needs it only on the one X chromosome he has. And then the other one's a Y chromosome. So this man will have hemophilia.
So a natural question should be arising is, hey, you know this guy-- let's just say that this is a relatively infrequent mutation that arises on an X chromosome-- the question is who's more likely to have hemophilia? A male or a female? All else equal, who's more likely to have it?
So let's say that the allele frequency of this is 1 in 7,000, the frequency of Xh, the hemophilia version of the X chromosome. And that's why 1 in 7,000 men display it, because it's completely determined whether-- there's a 1 in 7,000 chance that this X chromosome they get is the hemophilia version.
Who cares what the Y chromosome they get is, cause that essentially doesn't code at all for the blood clotting factors and all of the things that drive hemophilia. Now, for a woman to get hemophilia, what has to happen?
She has to have two X chromosomes with the mutation. Well the probability of each of them having the mutation is 1 in 7,000. So the probability of her having hemophilia is 1 in 7,000 times 1 in 7,000, or that's 1 in what, 49 million.
But you have to remember that these numbers, the frequency is less than 1, so in the case of hemophilia, that was 1 in 7,000. So if you square 1 in 7,000, you get 1 in 49 million. Anyway, hopefully you found that interesting and now you know how we all become men and women.
Understanding the ethnic and religious commonalities and differences in the state or the region that used to be Yugoslavia can be quite confusing. But, what I want to do in this video is try to give a primer on it. It's really key to understanding some of the triggers of World War I and to, obviously, understand the breakup of Yugoslavia, which was quite ugly during the fall of communism in the late 80s and early 90s.
But, most linguists say they're pretty close to each other. And you can kind of categorize them as one language, as Serbo-Croation. And you see that it's now spoken in modern day
That is the commonality here, the thing that ties together this region. Now on top of that, the slovenian language is also Slavic it's closely related to Serbo-Croation.
In Macedonia they also speak a Slavic language. It's closer to Bulgarian, but it has some close ties, it's not completely different than Serbo-Croation. So you have this linguistic connection throughout this area.
So, this area, if you go back hundreds of years, it was under the control of various empires.
With the Austro-Hungarian Empire, you're talking about a Roman Catholic Empire. When you're talking about the Ottomans, you're dealing with a Muslim Empire. And they held different parts of this territory for hundreds of years.
Roughly half of the population, and it's been moving over the centuries, but the dominant religion there is Islam.
And, in general this is where it can be confusing. When people talk about a Bosniak, they're talking about a Bosnian Muslim.
But, Bosnia and Herzgovina also has significant fractions of Serbs, who are Eastern Orthodox, and that's why I put the brown here as well, it's about a third of the population and it also has a pretty sizeable Roman Catholic population or we can say Bosnian-Croats.
So, just to be clear here - it can be very confusing, even when you hear a history of it, or you hear it on the news - I remember in the 90s, hearing the news and getting very confused.
If someone is talking about a Bosnian Muslim, or a Bosniak, that's a Muslim living in Bosnia, that's what they tend to be referring to. If they say a Bosnian-Croat, this would be an ethnically Croat, who is
And then if you have a Bosnian Serb, this is someone who ethnically identifies themselves as a Serbian, or as a Serb, who lives in Bosnia and Herzegovina, but is probably going to be Eastern Orthodox. So, you can imagine, you have these strong linguistic and even ethnic ties, but at some point, because of the religion, and dialect changes, there's also a significant amount of differences here, especially when things got ugly, as you had the fall of Communism. So, hopefully this lays a groundwork of the commonalities and the differences here.
And just to finish up, with just a little bit of context, this was not a unified state until World War I was, to some degree was precipitated by a desire to make this a unified state. This ethnic grouping, this linguistic grouping, tended to be broken up with the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Ottoman Empire, entering into World War I you have this decline of the Ottoman Empire which started to allow these people to start to have more energy behind their desire to form a unified state.
Evaluate 3x^2-8x+7 when x=-2. So to evaluate this expression when x is equal to -2 everywhere that we see an x we just have to substitute it with a -2. So it would be 3 times, instead of x^2, it would be -2^2 minus 8 times... instead of 8 times x, 8 times -2 plus seven.
So we have 3 times -2^2. Well, that's just positive 4. Negative times a negative is a positive.
Minus 8 times -2 is -16. -16 plus 7. So 3 times 4 is 12.
Subtracting -16 is the same thing as adding positive 16. So, it's 12 plus 16 plus 7. And so this is equal to 12 plus 16 is 28.
Why do so many people reach success and then fail? One of the big reasons is, we think success is a one-way street. So we do everything that leads up to success, but then we get there.
"I don't need Prozac anymore." And I threw it away and haven't needed it since. I learned that success isn't a one-way street.
Where do you come from? It's such a simple question, but these days, of course, simple questions bring ever more complicated answers. People are always asking me where I come from, and they're expecting me to say India, and they're absolutely right insofar as 100 percent of my blood and ancestry does come from India.
And if "Where do you come from?" means "Where were you born and raised and educated?" then I'm entirely of that funny little country known as England, except I left England as soon as I completed my undergraduate education, and all the time I was growing up, I was the only kid in all my classes who didn't begin to look like the classic English heroes represented in our textbooks.
And if "Where do you come from?" means "Where do you pay your taxes?
Where do you see your doctor and your dentist?" then I'm very much of the United States, and I have been for 48 years now, since I was a really small child. Except, for many of those years, I've had to carry around this funny little pink card with green lines running through my face identifying me as a permanent alien.
And if "Where do you come from?" means "Which place goes deepest inside you and where do you try to spend most of your time?" then I'm Japanese, because I've been living as much as I can for the last 25 years in Japan.
Except, all of those years I've been there on a tourist visa, and I'm fairly sure not many Japanese would want to consider me one of them. And I say all this just to stress how very old-fashioned and straightforward my background is, because when I go to Hong Kong or Sydney or Vancouver, most of the kids I meet are much more international and multi-cultured than I am. And they have one home associated with their parents, but another associated with their partners, a third connected maybe with the place where they happen to be, a fourth connected with the place they dream of being, and many more besides.
If somebody suddenly asks me, "Where's your home?" I think about my sweetheart or my closest friends or the songs that travel with me wherever I happen to be. And I'd always felt this way, but it really came home to me, as it were, some years ago when I was climbing up the stairs in my parents' house in California, and I looked through the living room windows and I saw that we were encircled by 70-foot flames, one of those wildfires that regularly tear through the hills of California and many other such places.
And three hours later, that fire had reduced my home and every last thing in it except for me to ash. And when I woke up the next morning, I was sleeping on a friend's floor, the only thing I had in the world was a toothbrush
"Where is your home?" I literally couldn't point to any physical construction. My home would have to be whatever I carried around inside me.
The number of people living in countries not their own now comes to 220 million, and that's an almost unimaginable number, but it means that if you took the whole population of Canada and the whole population of Australia and then the whole population of Australia again and the whole population of Canada again and doubled that number, you would still have fewer people than belong to this great floating tribe.
And the number of us who live outside the old nation-state categories is increasing so quickly, by 64 million just in the last 12 years, that soon there will be more of us than there are Americans. Already, we represent the fifth-largest nation on Earth. And in fact, in Canada's largest city, Toronto, the average resident today is what used to be called a foreigner, somebody born in a very different country.
The real voyage of discovery, as Marcel Proust famously said, consists not in seeing new sights, but in looking with new eyes. And of course, once you have new eyes, even the old sights, even your home become something different. Many of the people living in countries not their own are refugees who never wanted to leave home and ache to go back home.
They move to New York City. (Laughter) Or Edinburgh.
"Really?" I said. I'm always a bit skeptical when people say things like that.
"No, honestly," he went on,
"it's only three hours away by car, and it's not very expensive, and it's probably not like anywhere you've stayed before."
"Hmm." I was beginning to get slightly intrigued. "What is it?"
"Well —" Here my friend hemmed and hawed — "Well, actually it's a Catholic hermitage." This was the wrong answer.
We started Universal Subtitles because we believe every video on the web should be subtitle-able.
Millions of deaf and hard-of-hearing viewers require subtitles to access video.
Videomakers and websites should really care about this stuff too.
Subtitles give them access to a wider audience and they also get better search rankings.
Universal Subtitles makes it incredibly easy to add subtitles to almost any video.
Take an existing video on the web, submit the URL to our website and then type along with the dialog to create the subtitles
After that, tap on your keyboard to sync them with the video.
Then you're doneâ€" we give you an embed code for the video that you can put on any website at that point, viewers are able to use the subtitles and can also contribute to translations.
We support videos on YouTube, Blip.TV, Ustream, and many more.
Plus we're adding more services all the time
Universal Subtitles works with many popular video formats, such as MP4, theora, webM and over HTML 5.
Our goal is for every video on the web to be subtitlable so that anyone who cares about the video can help make it more accessible.
The volume of a cube is equal to its length times its width times its height. A cube with side x has length x, width x, and height x. So its volume is equal to x times x times x, or x to the third.
Do you know that we have 1.4 million cellular radio masts deployed worldwide? And these are base stations. And we also have more than five billion of these devices here.
So let's look at this in the context of the entire electromagnetic spectrum, where we have gamma rays. You don't want to get close to gamma rays, it could be dangerous.
X-rays, useful when you go to hospitals. Then there's ultraviolet light. it's good for a nice suntan, but otherwise dangerous for the human body. Infrared -- due to eye safety regulations, can be only used with low power.
LED light bulbs.
An LED is a semiconductor. It's an electronic device. And it has a very nice acute property.
Not usable for a YouTube video. What we have done is we have developed a technology with which we can furthermore replace the remote control of our light bulb. We transmit with our technology, not only a single data stream, we transmit thousands of data streams in parallel, at even higher speeds.
And the technology we have developed -- it's called SlM OFDM. And it's spacial modulation -- these are the only technical terms, I'm not going into details -- but this is how we enabled that light source to transmit data. You will say, "Okay, this is nice -- a slide created in 10 minutes."
So, all we would need to do is to fit a small microchip to every potential illumination device. And this would then combine two basic functionalities: illumination and wireless data transmission. And it's this symbiosis that I personally believe could solve the four essential problems that face us in wireless communication these days.

Is Mars red hot? Mars may look hot, but don't let its color fool you -- Mars is actually pretty cold!
Let's say that we have three integers, a, b, and c, and we know that all of these integers are greater than 0. So they're integers, and they are greater than 0. And we also know that the expression a plus b over c, that this is also an integer.
A baby's T-shirt requires 4/5 yards of fabric, or 4/5 of a yard of fabric. How many T-shirts can be made from 48 yards? So what we want to do is we essentially want to say how many groups of 4/5 of a yard can we make with 48 yards?
Solve for x: we 8 time the quantity 3x + 10 is equal to 28x - 14 - 4x Like every equation we've done so far, we just want to isolate all the x's on one side of this equation. But before we do that, we can actually simplify each of these sides.
So this is the same thing as 8 times 3x which is 24x plus 8 times 10 which is 80 is equal to and over here we have 28x - 14 - 4x so we can combine the 28x and the -4x 28x - 4x that is 24x and then you have the -14 right over here. Now the next thing we can do and it's already looking a little bit suspiscious but just to confirm that it's as suspicious as it looks, let's try to subtract 24x from both sides of this equation.
And then we're left with: on the left hand side these guys cancel out you're left with just 80 is equal to is equal to - these guys cancel out as well - is equal to -14 Now this looks very bizarre. So we're making a statement that 80 is equal to -14 which we know is not true.
 Given the graph of y equals f of x pictured below, determine the equations of all vertical asymptotes. So let's see what's going on here.
In the first video on evolution, I gave the example of the peppered moth during the Industrial Revolution in England and how, before the Industrial Revolution, there were a bunch of moths: some were dark, some were light, some were in between. But then once everything became soot filled, all of a sudden, the dark moths were less likely to be caught by predators and so all of the white moths were less likely to be able to reproduce successfully, so the black moth trait, or that variant, dominated.
In Wikipedia, they said, look, there's two competing theories here. One theory is that this, even though to us humans, the way we see things, it looks like an owl's eye, that this is actually a decoy. When some predator wants to eat one of these things, they go for the thing that looks most substantive.
Let's do a little review of what the Fed funds rate was. And then we can move into something that you've probably heard in the same context, and they're often confused, and that's the discount rate. And they are related and they kind of do move together.
Welcome to my presentation on equivalent fractions. So equivalent fractions are essentially what they sound like They're two fractions that although they use different numbers, they actually represent the same thing.
Or I ate 2/4 of the pie. Well if we look at these two pictures, we can see that I've eaten the same amount of the pie.
pieces in the pie, then I have to eat twice as many pieces to eat the same amount of pie. Let's do some more examples of equivalent fractions and hopefully it'll hit the point home. Let me erase this.
Oh boy, this thing is messing up. And that's how we got 21/35. So it's interesting.
When I graduated UCLA, I moved to northern California, and I lived in a little town called Elk on the Mendocino coast, and I didn't have a phone or TV, but I had U.S. mail, and life was good back then, if you could remember it.
I'd go to the general store for a cup of coffee and a brownie, and I'd ship my film to San Francisco, and lo and behold, two days later, it would end up on my front door, which was way better than having to fight the traffic of Hollywood. (Music) I didn't have much money, but I had time and a sense of wonder.
"Oh my God." Have you ever wondered what that meant?
The "oh" means it caught your attention, makes you present, makes you mindful.
The "my" means it connects with something deep inside your soul. It creates a gateway for your inner voice to rise up and be heard. And "God"?
So I have a gift I want to share with you today, a project I'm working on called Happiness Revealed, and it'll give us a glimpse into that perspective from the point of view of a child and an elderly man of that world. Child: When I watch TV, it's just some shows that you just -- that are pretend, and when you explore, you get more imagination than you already had, and when you get more imagination, it makes you want to go deeper in so you can get more and see beautifuller things,
If you do nothing else but to cultivate that response to the great gift that this unique day is, if you learn to respond as if it were the first day in your life and the very last day, then you will have spent this day very well. Begin by opening your eyes and be surprised that you have eyes you can open, that incredible array of colors that is constantly offered to us for pure enjoyment. Look at the sky.
(Applause)
Louie Schwartzberg: Thank you. Thank you very much.
Well now you've learned what I think is quite possibly one of the most useful concepts in life, and you might already be familiar with it, but if you're not this will hopefully keep you from one day filing for bankruptcy. So anyway, I will talk about interest, and then simple versus compound interest. So what's interest?
So we're asked: How many liters of soda do we have for the party? And they give us all of this other information.
Fifty years ago in the old Soviet Union, a team of engineers was secretly moving a large object through a desolate countryside. With it, they were hoping to capture the minds of people everywhere by being the first to conquer outer space. The rocket was huge.
"We are about to create a new planet that we will call Sputnik. In the olden days, explorers like Vasco da Gama and Columbus had the good fortune to open up the terrestrial globe.
It tells the story of Sputnik, and the story of what happened to America as a result. For days after the launch,
Sputnik was a wonderful curiosity. A man-made moon visible by ordinary citizens, it inspired awe and pride that humans had finally launched an object into space. But just three days later, on a day they called Red Monday, the media and the politicians told us, and we believed, that Sputnik was proof that our enemy had beaten us in science and technology, and that they could now attack us with hydrogen bombs, using their Sputnik rocket as an IBM missile.
All hell broke loose.
Sputnik quickly became one of the three great shocks to hit America -- historians say the equal of Pearl Harbor or 9/11. It provoked the missile gap. It exploded an arms race.
And the reactions to Sputnik went far beyond weapons increases. For example, some here will remember this day, June 1958, the National Civil Defense Drill, where tens of millions of people in 78 cities went underground. Or the Gallup Poll that showed that seven in 10 Americans believed that a nuclear war would happen, and that at least 50 percent of our population was going to be killed.
And Vint Cerf points out that Sputnik
led directly to ARPA, and the Internet, and, of course, NASA. My feature documentary shows how a free society can be stampeded by those who know how to use media. But it also shows how we can turn what appears at first to be a bad situation, into something that was overall very good for America.
"Sputnik" will soon be released. In closing, I would like to take a moment to thank one of my investors: longtime TEDster, Jay Walker.
 Categorize the following triangles according to whether or not they are obtuse triangles. So an obtuse triangle is a triangle that has an obtuse angle in it, or an angle that is larger than 90 degrees.
Well, an obtuse angle is one that's larger than 90 degrees. None of these are larger than 90. That's not true.
Let's say that we have the number 5 and we're asked... what number do we need to add to the number 5 to get to 0 and you might already know this but let's draw it out so let's say we have a number line over here and 0 is sitting right over there we are already sitting here at 5 so to go from 5 to 0 we have to go 5 spaces to the left and if we are going 5 space to the left that means we are adding negative 5 (-5) so if we add negative 5 right here than that is going to bring us back to 0 and you probably already knew this and this is a pretty... maybe common sense thing here but there is a fancy word for it called the additive inverse property and i'll just right it down, i think it's ridiculous that this is given such a fancy word for such a simple idea additive inverse property, and it is just the idea that if you have a number and if you add the additive inverse of the number, which most people call the negative of the number you add the negative of your number you will get back to 0 because they have the same size, you could view it that way, they both have a magnitude of 5, but this is going 5 to the right and this is going 5 to the left Similarly, if you started at negative 3 (-3) if your starting over here at -3 so you already moved 3 spaces to the left. and someone says...
"What do i have to add to -3 to get back to 0?" well i have to move 3 spaces to the right now. and 3 spaces to the right is in the positive direction so i have to add positive 3 (+3) so if i add positive 3 to negative 3 i will get 0 so in general, if i have any number... 1 million seven hundred twenty five thousand three hundred and fourteen (1,725,314) and i say... what do i need to add to this to get back to zero well i have to essentially go in the opposite direction, i have to go in the leftwards direction so i'm going to subtract the same amount. or i can say i can add the additive inverse or add the negative version of it. so this is going to be the same thing as adding -1,725,314 and that will get me back to zero (0) similarly, what number do i need to add to -7 to get to 0. well if i'm already at -7 i need to add positive 7 ( 7 to the right) so this is going to be equal to 0 and this all comes form the general idea. 5+-5 : 5+ the - of 5: or 5 + the additive inverse of 5 you can just view this, and as another way as 5 - 5 and if you have 5 of something then you take you take away 5 then you learned many many years ago that, that is going to get you 0
The seventeen hundreds in Europe are often referred to as the age of enlightenment, it was a time we had come out of the renaissance, we'd rediscovered science and reason, and in the seventeen hundreds, we saw that come about with even more progress of society. As we exit the seventeen hundreds and enter into the eighteen hundreds, we start having the industrial revolution, and people saw the steady march of human reason, of human progress. And because of... because of this, a lot of people were saying
Now the other dimension where you might say that he was maybe wrong, was in this principle that a population will increase if it CAN increase, that if there IS food and there IS time, people WlLL reproduce. And a good counterpoint to that is what we've now observed in modern developed nations. And so this right over here shows the population growth.
We're asked to move the orange dot to -0.6 on the number line So the point, the dot, right now is at zero... and let's see this is -2, this is positive 2. So, each of these big slashes looks like it's 1
Let's do some problems with plotting points and graphical representations of functions. So I didn't write the problem here, but what they ask us to do here is figure out the coordinates of each of these points. So let's just do that.
So its x-coordinate is how far to the left or the right it is of the origin. And it is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 to the left, or it is negative 6 of the origin, or it's at the coordinate negative 6.
So negative 6, that's right there. And then its y-coordinate, which is how high it is, that is right there. That's 4.
It's 8 to the left of the origin.
Negative 8. And its y-coordinate, it's 2 below the origin. So its y-coordinate right there is negative 2.
And then its-- I'm sorry, its x-coordinate is at 4, and then its y-coordinate, how far down it is, or in this vertical axis, it is-- this looks like negative 7.
And then, finally, we are on e. I'm picking out a nice color for e. e right there. Its x-coordinate is 5.
Write the function rule for each graph. So we have this little v looking thing. So we could write it a couple of ways.
Negative 1/2 times negative 4 is positive 2. So it's negative 1/2 times x, when x is less than 0. So this is a completely legitimate answer.
But then for negative values, the absolute value of x is equal to negative x. So you take negative 2 here.
Negative 2, take the absolute value, you get 2 times 1/2 is 1. So either of these would be legitimate function definitions. Problem 10.
This looks like, I don't know, maybe it's equal to, it could be equal to 1.9 or it could be-- what is this?-- negative 1.9. This is not a proper function definition. I don't know whether f of 2 is this value or that value.
Just realized that I typed in the wrong numbers at the end of the last video when I was trying to put them in the calculator. We were trying to determine the coefficient of static friction - and it's 50 Newtons divided by 49 square roots of 3 Newtons. And in the last video, by accident, in the calculator, instead of doing 49 square roots of 3,
Our mental peace or inner peace is the true source of happiness, and when I say happiness, I don't just mean superficial happiness, like our ordinary pleasures that easily turn into pain, or our excitements that easily become disappointments. When I say happiness, I mean a deep inner peace and joy, a contentment and well-being that we can share with others.
Whenever you begin meditation, the first thing to do is find a comfortable meditation posture.
And the most important thing is that your back is nice and straight.
This will help you to remain much more alert during the meditation.
Your eyes can be partially closed,
and your hands resting comfortably inside your lap.
And then, allow your mind to just relax,
letting go of all ordinary concerns,
and temporarily to stop thinking about anything.
And then you can turn your attention to the sensation of your breathing.
Gently and naturally, inhale and exhale through your nostrils.
Become aware of the sensation of your breath right at the tip of your nostrils as you inhale and exhale.
This sensation is your object of meditation.
With mindfulness, focus on this sensation, the gentle rhythm of your breathing, to the exclusion of everything else.
If other thoughts begin to arise,
resist the temptation to follow them.
Remain mindful of the sensation of your breathing,
moment by moment.
If, at any time, your mind has wandered and is following your thoughts,
then immediately, but gently bring your awareness back to the sensation of your breath.
Continue to do this until your mind begins to settle or rest in a gentle rhythm of your breathing.
And just for the last minute or so,
remain mindful of the sensation of your breath.
And in this way, through gentle effort in meditation,
when the busyness of turbulent distracting thoughts subside,
we have the opportunity to experience our own mind as very still, peaceful, clear, and spacious.
And this mental peace is a sign of the much greater potential for peace that already lies within us.
We are tapping into our potential to create peace.
And before we arise from this meditation,
we can develop a determination to maintain this peaceful mind and good heart,
and to share this experience with others.
In this way, may everyone find true happiness,
and may we create peace in our world.
And so, when you're ready, you can begin to gently relax your concentration, and as you slowly arise from the meditation, please bring this peaceful feeling with you.
Thank you very much.
We humans like to get our heads around all of the complexity around us by classifying things. And you could imagine there's no more obvious thing to classify than all of the living things around us, than all of the life that surrounds us. So what I want to start talking about is, how do we classify all of the life around us?
Things that look like each other or things that act like each other, because what we'll see is that there's some things that could be very different, at least in and how they look or act, but are actually closely related. And we'll talk about what it means to be closely related. And then we can see things that look very similar, that they have similar structures or they have similar behavior,
And so the most typical definition for species are animals that can interbreed. And when we say interbreed, literally they can produce offspring with each other, and the offspring are fertile. Which means that the offspring can then further have babies, that they're not sterile, that they're capable of breeding with other animals and producing more offspring.
Find the probability of flipping exactly two heads on 3 coins. So to figure out this probability, a good place to start is just to think about all of the different possible ways that we can flip 3 coins. So we could get all tails.
So the probability of flipping exactly 2 heads-- And the word exactly is important, because if you didn't say exactly, then maybe 3 heads, when you flip 2 heads, so we have to say exactly 2 heads. So you don't include the situation where you get 3 heads. So the probability of flipping exactly 2 heads is equal to the 3 outcomes with 2 heads divided by the 8 possible outcomes, or 3/8.
Hello My name is James White. Today, we'll be investigating heat transfer. Heat transfer affects our everyday life
A Thermo camera can see the radiation given off by all objects and use it to measure their temperature. . For example, cold objects normally give off less radiation, than hot objects, which give off more radiation. The camera records this radiation and creates a picture.
Heat transfers from the high temperature side to the low temperature side. Let's watches this happens. Over time, the temperature of the material becomes more and more uniform as heat transfer moves energy from hot to cold areas of the wire.
Materials that are thicker, will let less heat through and the materials with high thermal conductivity will let more heat through. How do you think this metal door compares to this sponge penal? Which lets through more heat?
The sun is extremely hot object, and a its thermal radiation. warms our entire planet. This means when designing the building, window placement is the very important part of the thermal engineering When the suns" radiation comes through windows, it will heat up the exposed cooler indoor materials.

Look at the two thermometers below. Identify which is Celsius and which is Fahrenheit, and then label the boiling and freezing points of water on each.
Celsius scale is on the Celsius scale, 0 degrees is freezing of water at standard temperature and pressure, and 100 degrees is the boiling point of water at standard temperature and pressure. Now, on the Fahrenheit scale, which is used mainly in the United States, the freezing point of water is 32 degrees, and boiling of water is 212 degrees.
So this thing on the right, right here, I guess I'll circle it in orange, that is Celsius. And then the one on the left, I'll do it in magenta, the one on the left is Fahrenheit.
Let's do one more example dealing with displacement, velocity and time. So we have: If Marcia travels for 1 minute at 5 m/s to the south, how much will she be displaced?

So, I am indeed going to talk about the spaces men create for themselves, but first I want to tell you why I'm here. I'm here for two reasons. These two guys are my two sons Ford and Wren.
When Ford was about three years old, we shared a very small room together, in a very small space. My office was on one half of the bedroom, and his bedroom was on the other half. And you can imagine, if you're a writer, that things would get really crowded around deadlines.
As I was building this space, I thought to myself, "Surely I'm not the only guy to have to have carved out a space for his own." So I did some research. And I found that there was an historic precedence.
Hemingway had his writing space.
Elvis had two or three manspaces, which is pretty unique because he lived with both his wife and his mother in Graceland. In the popular culture, Superman had the Fortress of Solitude, and there was, of course, the Batcave. So I realized then that I wanted to go out on a journey and see what guys were creating for themselves now.
It is in Austin, Texas, which is where I'm from. On the outside it looks like a very typical garage, a nice garage. But on the inside, it's anything but.
 We're told to graph all possible values for h on the number line. And this is a especially interesting inequality because we also have an absolute value here.
So the way we're going to do it, we're going to solve this inequality in terms of the absolute value of h, and from there we can solve it for h. So let's just get the absolute value of h on one side of the equation. So the easiest way to do this is to add 19 and 1/2 to both sides of this equation.
So h could be less than 7 and 1/2. But if it gets too far negative, if it goes to negative 3, we're cool, negative 4, negative 5, negative 6, negative 7, we're still cool, but then at negative 8, all of a sudden the absolute value isn't going to be less than this. So it also has to be greater than negative 7 and 1/2.
Let's learn a little bit about just how a plain vanilla bank works. So let's say that I'm an entrepreneur and I see a problem out there in the world. You have all of these hardworking people
Now we see how to modify the Tree Search Function to make it be a Graph Search Function to avoid those repeated paths. What we do, is we start off and initialize a set called the explored set of states that we have already explored. Then, when we consider a new path, we add the new state to the set of already explored states, and then when we are expanding the path and adding in new states to the end of it, we don't add that in if we have already seen that new state in either the frontier or the explored.
Arad is crossed off the list.
The path that goes from Arad to Sibiu and back to Arad is removed, and we are left with these one, two, three, four, five possible paths.
Identify all sets of parallel and perpendicular lines in the image below. So let's start with the parallel lines and, just as a reminder, two lines are parallel if they're in the same plane, and all of these lines are clearly in the same plane. They are in the plane of the screen your viewing right now.
UV: they both intersect line CD at the exact same angle, at this angle right here. And, in particular, it is at a right angle. And if you have two lines that intersect a third line at the same angle, at the same angle. so that these are actually corresponding angles.
So Line ST- you put the arrows on each end of that top bar to say that this a line and not just a line segment.
Line ST is parallel (two lines) to Line UV. And I think that is the only set of parallel lines in this diagram. Yup.
So for example Line ST is perpendicular to Line CD. And we know that they intersect at a right angle or a 90 degree angle because they gave us this little box here which literally means that the measure of this angle is 90 degrees. By the exact same argument, Line UV is perpendicular to CD.
UV (make sure I specify these as lines) is perpendicular to CD. And so UV, ST they're perpendicular to CD. And then after that, the only other information where they definitely tell us that two lines are intersecting at right angles are Line AB and WX.
So Line AB is definitely perpendicular to Line WX.
Line WX. And, I think we are done.
And one thing to think about AB and CD, well they don't even intersect, so we can't make a comment about them being perpendicular, but they are definitely not parallel You can even imagine that it looks like they are about to intersect. And they give us no information that they intersect at the same lines, at the same angle.
Thank you, Pat. What a blessing to be here in the spirit of resilience and hope. Standing next to me is my dear friend, Robert Makatengae.
(Applause) This song was inspired by a television program I watched, about women and war. And sometimes there's no place to turn when something hits you so hard, other than music or a song, or something you create, a prayer.

18 minutes is an absolutely brutal time limit, so I'm going to dive straight in, right at the point where I get this thing to work. Here we go. I'm going to talk about five different things.
The first one I'm going to talk about is how to get from a relatively modest amount of life extension -- which I'm going to define as 30 years, applied to people who are already in middle-age when you start -- to a point which can genuinely be called defeating aging.
Namely, essentially an elimination of the relationship between how old you are and how likely you are to die in the next year -- or indeed, to get sick in the first place. And of course, the last thing I'm going to talk about is how to reach that intermediate step, that point of maybe 30 years life extension. So I'm going to start with why we should.
"Well, if we fix aging, no one's going to die to speak of, or at least the death toll is going to be much lower, only from crossing St. Giles carelessly. And therefore, we're not going to be able to have many kids, and kids are really important to most people." And that's true.
The geriatrician will intervene late in the day, when pathology is becoming evident, and the geriatrician will try and hold back the sands of time, and stop the accumulation of side effects from causing the pathology quite so soon. Of course, it's a very short-term-ist strategy; it's a losing battle, because the things that are causing the pathology are becoming more abundant as time goes on.
The gerontology approach looks much more promising on the surface, because, you know, prevention is better than cure. But unfortunately the thing is that we don't understand metabolism very well. In fact, we have a pitifully poor understanding of how organisms work -- even cells we're not really too good on yet.
RNA interference only a few years ago, and this is a really fundamental component of how cells work. Basically, gerontology is a fine approach in the end, but it is not an approach whose time has come when we're talking about intervention. So then, what do we do about that?
We can say that, fundamentally, the difference between gerontology and geriatrics is that gerontology tries to inhibit the rate at which metabolism lays down this damage.
And I'm going to explain exactly what damage is in concrete biological terms in a moment.
And geriatricians try to hold back the sands of time by stopping the damage converting into pathology. And the reason it's a losing battle is because the damage is continuing to accumulate. So there's a third approach, if we look at it this way.
And of course the main thing is that you shouldn't trust people who call themselves gerontologists because, as with any radical departure from previous thinking within a particular field, you know, you expect people in the mainstream to be a bit resistant and not really to take it seriously. So, you know, you've got to actually do your homework, in order to understand whether this is true. And we'll just end with a few things.
Chris Anderson: OK. I don't know if there's going to be any questions but I thought I would give people the chance.
CA: The genes don't care but we do? AG:
Determine whether this system has no solutions or infinite solutions. So let's think about how we can go about doing this. So at any point, we might not have to solve this entirely if we somehow get something that is nonsensical which will tell us no solution, or we might have to go further and see if it's one of infinite number solutions.

Good morning. I have a couple of questions. How do you become a super hero?
Of course he can fly, he also has X-ray vision. We have succeeded in harnessing X-ray vision.
Please look at the screen.
Can you see as if I am transparent?
OK. You can also see...
my skeleton, (Laughter)
like this as if you have X-ray vision.
You can also use this technique outdoors, like this. (Video)
When I was a child (Laughter)
- it's me - one of my dreams was to become a magician. However, I was very awkward when it came to doing magic. Therefore, I made a decision to become an engineer instead of a magician.
This is the secret of X-ray vision that was demonstrated earlier. This system is called 'optical camouflage.' I put on the special cloak which is made with retro-reflective cloth.
We have integrated this transparent technology in a car, however, we use it not for a car's exterior, but for its interior. As you can see here, you are able to drive a car as if it were made of transparent glass.
She is a novice Sunday driver who got a driver's license just one year ago. Thanks to this technology she can easily observe the parking spot. Oh, something is in the way!
(Laughter) The transparency acts as a supplement to the rear view and the side mirrors. Finally, she succeeded in parking the car perfectly.
In the future, enjoying a rainy drive, you might enjoy the clear sky through the roof, as well as the clouds, like these. So you can enjoy Tokyo Tower clearly.
If you have an unexpected visitor, this system helps you to see the person at the door. (Laughter) (Applause) He is our friend.
As you already know, Sir Arthur C. Clarke, a famous science fiction novelist mentioned:
"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." I believe I became a sort of technology magician like my childhood dream.
(Applause) Thank you. (Applause)
So, I'd like to cast a spell upon the world with our technology. Thank you very much. (Applause)

Giles Shih: My name is Giles Shih. I'm President and CEO of BioResource International.
We're a agriculture/biotechnology company based in the RTP area, Research Triangle Park in North Carolina. We are basically helping to grow healthier and bigger chickens in a sustainable way.
Our customers would be the Purdues and Tysons of the world, and the Smithfield's, the ones that are growing poultry and growing swine.
What they do is they add the product as an additive about one pound per ton of feed, or half a kilo per metric ton in their feed mills where they're mixing corn and soybean and other rations, and then deliver it to the farms that way. We sell our product into Brazil, into India, eventually into China; huge populations that have a need for growing more poultry and swine. We are a part of that and that's really exciting, for us and for a lot of people.
In India and China, they have to be more resourceful and find ways to grow their chickens and pigs economically, sustainable and environmentally sustainable ways. We're not just helping to grow bigger chickens. We're feeding the world.
Find the slope of the line pictured on the graph. So the slope of a line is defined to be rise over run. Or you can also view it as change in y over change in x.
Welcome to our programming tutorials on Khan Academy. Are you completely new to computer programming? Well, don't worry--that means that you're like 99.5% of the world.
Thankfully, programming isn't this obscure skill that only special people can do-- It's something that we can all learn. Kids, teens, adults from all over the world are learning programming today.
What's so "cool" about programming? Why are all those people learning it? Well, it really depends on what you think is "cool," because, as it turns out, you can use programming for almost everything.
Today people write programs to do everything from helping doctors and patients cure diseases; helping save endangered species all over the world; making self-driving cars, so that you never have to worry about learning to drive when you get older; creating algorithmic jewelry; designing robots that can take care of patients, or robots that can roam around Mars and look for water on the surface; making really fun games,
like Doodle Jump, Draw Something, Angry Birds, any game that you've played; making movies like all those awesome 3-D movies from Pixar, like Avatar, or making computer graphics to go inside live-action movies
like Facebook, and Google Maps, and Wikipedia, and YouTube, and Pinterest; and, of course, educating the world on websites like Khan Academy, where you are now.
So, right now, on Khan Academy, you can learn to make your own art and games which will give you a great start towards creating whatever you can imagine. It might be hard to see how a drawing program relates to making websites, programming phones, or curing diseases, but believe it or not, the same basic concepts are used by pretty much every programmer, in almost every program. That means that once you learn to code on Khan Academy, you'll be able to learn other sorts of coding way more easily.
Hello!
Good Morning TedX San Diego! Hey! So good to be here.
Ben Underwood is someone who became famous to us in this world because he was someone who we labeled as blind, but he actually had the ability to see in a different way. He had something called echolocation which you've heard about before with dolphins and bats. He, like some people who don't have sight, found a way to create sound waves.
People became fascinated by Ben's story, but that's not what moved me so much about Ben's story. There was something else that was different about Ben that really touched my heart. Now as much as I understand that people are fascinated at the result that he accomplished in his life, which was, let's be straight, was incredible, what I was curious about in watching him was what is the thinking that gets somebody to create that kind of result in their lives?
What is it inside of a person that refuses to say: "I will label myself as blind?" And find another way?
And what that is, was a conversation that took place between Ben and his mother the day of his surgery. Now, he was two weeks shy of his third birthday, and his mother had put him through intense chemotherapy because he had had cancer in both eyes. And, she had a choice to make:
"Do I give Ben a ton of chemotherapy and keep risking his life and maybe save his eyes? Or do I remove his eyes entirely? And if I do, he'll live, but he'll have no sight."
And what she did was, as soon as Ben woke up and said, "Mom, I can't see," she immediately said to him, "Ben, yes, you can." And in his own words, she said, "I took his little hands and I placed them on my cheeks and I said, "Ben you can see with your hands." And then I said, "Ben, here," and I gave him my arm, and I let him smell my skin.
And she said: "Ben, you can smell my skin, and you can see with your smell." And then I whispered in his ear:
"Ben, you can absolutely see. You can see with your ears." And one, two, three, Aquanetta, his mother, went through the various ways in which Ben could see.
He began to ask himself not " Why can't I see?", but "In what ways can I see?" And for the love and the passion of that possibility, he searched for his own and therefore it would only make sense that he would create a new way. That's what inspires me about him.
- and don't get me wrong, I marvel at his results, the fact that he could have echolocation, and that people would sit there and study him is incredible - but what moved me to tears again is the search for another possibility. I relate to that in my own life because well, you guys know, that at some point, I ended up homeless in my life. And that happened becauseI grew up in the Bronx in a very tough neighborhood.
But, you know, people listen when they hear my story and I guess much like Ben, when they study his echolocation, they want him to be able to distinguish the telephone from the computer, or whatever they did with him, people would often ask me very strange questions about being homeless. People would ask me, "Did you eat from the trash?" Or "Where did you sleep?"
And there is a quote that I love by Dr. Martin Luther King:
"Your life begins to end the day you become silent about things that matter." And feeling that inside of me, that was the most dangerous thing about being in my situation, but what occurred was incredible. I had a transformational experience.
But there was this feeling in my heart, that I want so badly to transfer to everyone that I meet now, which is that passion that I felt for that "What would happen if I just kept going? Even if there was every evidence in the world that it wouldn't work out, what if? And for the idea that even though it was unlikely after being told no so many times, it was possible that the next school would accept me.
I didn't know that I would actually be able to lift myself out of homeless, go on to Harvard, graduate and entirely change my life. Like Ben, who I mentioned in the beginning, people get pretty fixated and fascinated on the result.
"Talk to me about Harvard." Or, "Talk to me about the mechanics of how you did what you did." People think about that.
I always hear people say: "It's great you have all the passion you have. Get it done while you're young."
Say, "I." (Audience) I! And so I hear this with youth, and I always thought that sounded kind of screwy because what's the implication?
And if I could leave you with something, I'll tell you that as I moved through these obstacles in my life, I was tempted so much to think that because of my past I could not change my future, but that feeling of, "OK, I'll let it go. What will happen if I apply to school? What will happen if I apply to the scholarship?
Use less than or greater than for this little brackets thing to write a true sentence. So they essentially want us to say whether 45.675 is greater than or less than 45.645. So let's look at each of these numbers.
We've talked a lot about convex lenses, so I thought I would do a quick video on concave lenses, although there aren't as many combinations of what a concave lens can do. So just remember, concave has the word 'cave' in it so I always imagine that it's kind of caving inwards caving inwards It's a little bit of an exaggerated drawing but you get the general idea this is a concave lens right over here and let me draw its principle axis so this is its princinpal axis shouldn't curve at the beginning just redraw it, so that's its principle axis and let me draw the two focal points
They're asking us to draw a right triangle, so that means it has to have a 90 degree angle. And it's also an isosceles triangle, so that means it has to have at least two sides equal, and has two sides of length 3. So those two sides are going to be equal or are going to be of length 3, it's got to be a right triangle.
"Is this the only triangle that I could have drawn that meets these conditions?" Well, I can't change this angle if I want to meet these conditions, I can't change these two lengths, and if you keep this angle constant and you keep these two lengths constant, then this point and this point are going to be there no matter what, so this is the only side that can connect those two points.
We're asked to subtract, and we have the complex number two minus three i, and from that, we are subtracting six minus eighteen i. So, the first thing I'd like to do here is to just kind of get rid of these parentheses. So we just have a bunch of real parts and imaginary parts that we can then add up together.
So we can just distribute the negative sign and negative one times six is negative six--let me do these in magenta-- so this is negative six, and then negative one times negative eighteen i, well that's just going to be positive, positive eighteen i: negative times a negative is a positive.
And now we want to add the real parts and we want to add the imaginary parts, so here is a real part here: two, and then we have a minus six, so we have two minus six, and we want to add the imaginary parts. We have a negative--let me do that in a different color-- we have a negative three i right over here, so negative three i (or "minus three i") right over there, and then we have a plus eighteen i or positive eighteen i, so then we have a positive eighteen i. If you add the real parts: two minus six is negative four.
And you imag-- add the--add the imaginary parts: if I have negative three of something, and to that I add eighteen of something, well, that's just going to leave me with fifteen of that something. Or another way you can think about it: if I have eighteen of something and I subtract three of that something, I'll have fifteen of that something.
 We could have a debate about what the most interesting cell in the human body is, but I think easily the neuron would make the top five, and it's not just because the cell itself is interesting. The fact that it essentially makes up our brain and our nervous system and is responsible for the thoughts and our feelings and maybe for all of our sentience, I think, would easily make it the top one or two cells.
let me draw the nucleus. This is a nucleus, just like any cell's nucleus.
And then the soma's considered the body of the neuron and then the neuron has these little things sticking out from it that keep branching off. Maybe they look something like this. I don't want to spend too much time just drawing the neuron, but you've probably seen drawings like this before.
So these right here, these are dendrites. And these tend to be-- and nothing is always the case in biology. Sometimes different parts of different cells perform other functions, but these tend to be where the neuron receives its signal.
This right here is the soma. Soma means body. This is the body of the neuron.
Let me draw the axon. So the axon will look something like this. And at the end, it ends at the axon terminal where it can connect to other dendrites or maybe to other types of tissue or muscle if the point of this neuron is to tell a muscle to do something.
And a huge part in what allows them to travel efficiently are these insulating cells around the axon. We're going to talk about this in detail and how they actually work, but it's good just to have the anatomical structure first. So these are called Schwann cells and they're covering-- they make up the myelin sheath.
simplify 2 a square over 3 b to the fifth All of that to the fourth power So here we could use the property that if i have x over y to the Nth power this is the same thing as x to the Nth power over y to the nth power. we can see that with an exemple really fast. if i had x over y to the 3rd power what would be this equal to? that would be x over y times x over y times x over y which is equal to x times x times x over y times y times y
When I was a child, I always wanted to be a superhero. I wanted to save the world and make everyone happy. But I knew that I'd need superpowers to make my dreams come true.
I started my journey in California, with a UC Berkeley 30-year longitudinal study that examined the photos of students in an old yearbook, and tried to measure their success and well-being throughout their life. By measuring the students' smiles, researchers were able to predict how fulfilling and long-lasting a subject's marriage would be, (Laughter) how well she would score on standardized tests of well-being, and how inspiring she would be to others. In another yearbook, I stumbled upon Barry Obama's picture.
When I first saw his picture, I thought that his superpowers came from his super collar. (Laughter)
Smiling is one of the most basic, biologically uniform expressions of all humans. In studies conducted in Papua New Guinea, Paul Ekman, the world's most renowned researcher on facial expressions, found that even members of the Fore tribe, who were completely disconnected from Western culture, and also known for their unusual cannibalism rituals, (Laughter) attributed smiles to descriptions of situations the same way you and I would.
So from Papua New Guinea to Hollywood all the way to modern art in Beijing, we smile often, and use smiles to express joy and satisfaction. How many people here in this room smile more than 20 times per day? Raise your hand if you do.
In a related German study, researchers used fMRI imaging to measure brain activity before and after injecting Botox to suppress smiling muscles. The finding supported Darwin's theory, by showing that facial feedback modifies the neural processing of emotional content in the brain, in a way that helps us feel better when we smile. Smiling stimulates our brain reward mechanism in a way that even chocolate -- a well-regarded pleasure inducer -- cannot match.
In the last video on the lungs or the gas exchange in our bodies or on the pulmonary system, we left off with the alveolar sacs. Let me draw one right here. So we have these alveolar sacs that I talked about and they're in these little clumps like this.
In the last video, we saw that air, when we breathe in, when our diaphragm contracts and makes our lungs expand and fill up that space, air comes in. Air comes in and that air that comes in is going to be-- as we're breathing atmospheric air-- it's going to be 21% oxygen and it's going to be 78% nitrogen. And actually, in our atmosphere, carbon dioxide is actually almost a trace gas.
So any time you breathe in on Earth, this is what you're going to get. And we said in the last video that you have these capillaries, these pulmonary capillaries that are running all along the side of these alveoli. So let me draw those pulmonary capillaries-- and so when they are de-oxygenated-- so they come here to be oxygenated.
And then they pick up the oxygen from inside the alveoli-- or the oxygen diffuses across the membrane of the alveoli, into these capillaries, into these super small tubes. And then once they do, that makes the blood red. I'm going to talk in a little bit about why it becomes red.
This is the inside of of an alveolus. This is its membrane right here, super thin, almost one cell thick. And then you have a capillary running right next to it.
And this is porous to gases like oxygen, and nitrogen, carbon dioxide. And what we have here-- let's say that this is-- so the heart is over here. So this is blood coming from the heart and then this is going to go back to the heart.
I already did nitrogen as green. Let me do carbon dioxide as orange. There's a lot of carbon dioxide and actually carbon dioxide actually gets diffused in the blood.
Now the reason why I say it's special besides the fact that pulmonary arteries and veins go to and from the lungs, is that they're kind of the opposite. Because in the rest of the body when we're going away from the heart or we're talking about arteries, you're going to see that that's oxygenated blood, while when we're going away from the heart to the lungs, that's de-oxygenated blood. Similarly in the rest of the body, when we're going to the heart, where you're to see that that's de-oxygenated blood, but in the pulmonary vein, when we're going to the heart, it's oxygenated because the lungs are what take up the carbon dioxide and give us the oxygen.
There'd be a little divot on that side and there'd be a similar divot on the other side. And red blood cells-- and I could do a whole set of videos just on red blood cells-- they contain hemoglobin. Maybe we'll do a whole video on hemoglobin.
And no DNA. This is mind boggling when I first found out. I was like, well, why is it a cell?
All cells need a nucleus with DNA in order to generate the proteins that build it up, in order to exist and structurally make itself the way it needs to be made, but the whole point of a red blood cell is to contain as much hemoglobin as possible. And so you can imagine, this is actually a favorable evolutionary trait, that as red blood cells are ready to go into business, you've built the whole structure, they actually get rid of their nucleus.
They actually push their nucleus out of the cell and the whole reason why that's beneficial is, that's more space for hemoglobin.
Because the more hemoglobin you have, the more oxygen you can take up. And I can do a ton of videos on hemoglobin and all of that-- and actually, I'm going to do a lot more on the circulatory system so don't worry about that, but I want to go over one other really interesting thing about hemoglobin. We already talked about red blood cells.
Are are they still alive once they've lost their DNA or are they just vessels for oxygen that aren't really alive because they aren't regenerating and producing their own DNA? So actually, instead of going into the hemoglobin discussion right now, I'll leave you there in this video. I realize I've been making 20-minute videos where my goal is really to make ten-minute ones.
I'm used to thinking of the TED audience as a wonderful collection of some of the most effective, intelligent, intellectual, savvy, worldly and innovative people in the world. And I think that's true. However, I also have reason to believe that many, if not most, of you are actually tying your shoes incorrectly.
"I love the shoes, but I hate the laces." He took a look and said, "Oh, you're tying them wrong." Now up until that moment,
 My son has been successfully subdued, so I think this is a good time to learn about the Price to Earnings ratio. And a lot of times you'll hear people talk about a stock's P/E Ratio.
But let's say that the market price, let's say that this is
Widgets Inc. and let's say that its ticker symbol is
WlNC, for Widgets Inc. And its price is, it's trading at-- let me make up a good number-- let's say it's trading at $3.50.
And if you want to look at earnings per share, EPS, is this number divided by the number of shares was $0.35. So first, just to learn what the Price to Earnings ratio is, let's just calculate it. Then we can talk about what it actually means and if we have time, we can have a discussion on why a company might have a higher or lower Price to Earnings Ratio.
Maybe it's in the CD. So I have $102 at the end of the year. This 2% were my earnings.
Who knows what happens with Widgets Inc.? Maybe all of these guys were-- Maybe this is a big Ponzi scheme. I mean, most companies in this country aren't.
Because even though you're probably suspicious of them now, the US has some of the most transparent companies with some of the best accounting standards. If this was in-- you know, I don't want to state any countries because people all over the world listen to these videos-- but if it were a country with less solid accounting standards, you would be like, they might be making up all of their numbers so I don't trust it. Or you might say, you know, Widgets Inc., even though the analysts are saying that they're going to make $0.35 this coming year, you might say, you know, I don't believe that.
I think there's actually a lot of risk in Widgets Inc. That there's actually more volatility here than anyone gives credit for. They might go out of business.
So that's a little bit of a taste of why someone might realistically, in this case, pay a higher Price to Earnings for safety. Safety because you know that this earnings stream is guaranteed. And liquidity.
Let's learn a little bit about the wonderful world of logarithms.
So we already know how to take exponents. If I were to say 2 to the fourth power, what does that mean? Well that means 2 times 2 times 2 times 2.
Now the way that we would denote this with logarithm notation is we would say, log, base-- actually let me make it a little bit more colourful.
Log, base 2-- I'll do this 2 in blue...
Log, base 2, of 16 is equal to what, or is equal in this case since we have the 'x' there, is equal to 'x'? This and this are completely equivalent statements. This is saying "hey well if I take 2 to some 'x' power I get 16'."
log, base 3, of 81. What would this evaluate to? Well this is a reminder, this evaluates to the power we have to raise 3 to, to get to 81.
Why is a logarithm useful? And you'll see that it has very interesting properties later on.
But you didn't necessarily have to use algebra.
To do it this way, to say that 'x' is the power you raise 3 to to get to 81, you had to use algebra here, while with just a straight up logarithmic expression, you didn't really have to use any algebra, we didn't have to say that it was equal to 'x', we could just say that this evaluates to the power I need to raise 3 to to get to 81. The power I need to raise 3 to to get to 81. Well what power do you have to raise 3 to to get to 81?
Log, base 3, of 81, is equal to-- I'll do this in a different colour. Is equal to 4.
log, base 6, of 216. What will this evaluate to? Well we're asking ourselves, "what power do we have to raise 6 to, to get 216?"
log, base 2, of 64. So what does this evaluate to? Well once again we're asking ourselves, "well this will evaluate to the exponent that I have to raise this base 2, and you do this as a little subscript right here.
What is log, base 100, of 1? I'll let you think about that for a second.
100 is a subscript so it's, log, base 100, of 1. That's one way to think about it, I'll put parentheses around the 1. What does this evaluate to?
So log, base 100, of 1, is going to be equal to 0. Log base anything of 1, is going to be equal to 0 because anything to the 0 power and we're not talking about 0 here. Anything that is to the power of 0 that is not 0, is going to be equal to 1.
John Green: Hi there. My name is John Green.
Mr. Green, Mr. Green, Mr. Green!
John Green: Oh, me from the past. I forgot you wanted to go to Columbia.
But since you live in the past you have no way of knowing who I'm talking about and it occurs to me that this video may be watched in some glorious future when Kim Kardashian and the situation have mercifully disappeared from public life and the supermarket tabloids, instead of talking about celebrities, talk about Fuoco and the Higgs-Boson Particle.
So, Kim Kardashian is a professional famous person who initially rose to notoriety by scoodelipooping with someone named Ray J and Mike, the situation I forgot his last name, is a professional stupid person with big muscles.
They're both known by millions, live in luxury and people literally pay to own their odors. Why do these people crave fame? Why do any of us?
For a long time history was all about the study of great men and it was common to call people 'The Great', although these days historians are less likely to do that because they recognize that one mans great is generally another mans terrible and also 'The Great' has some misogynistic implications. Like it's almost always men who are called 'The Great'.
You never hear of Cleopatra the Great or Elizabeth the Great.
Sure, there's Catherine the Great of Russia, but for her masculine greatness, she was saddled with the completely untrue rumor that she died trying to scoodleypoop with a horse. Saddled? Get it?
Alexander was the son of King Philip II and when just 13 years old, he tamed a horse no one else could ride, named Bucephalus, which impressed is father so much that he said, "Oh thy son, whip thee out in a kingdom equal to and worthy of thyself for Macedonia is too little for thee." By that time he was already an accomplished general, but over the next decade he expanded his empire with unprecedented speed and he is famous for having never lost a battle. Today we're going to look at Alexander of Macedon's story by examining three possible definitions of greatness.
He conquered all the land the Persians had held, including Egypt, and then marched toward India, stopping at the Indus river only because his army was like,
"Hey, Alexander. You know what would be awesome? Not marching."
Okay.
Is because of Napoleon.
Napoleon, like many other generals through the millennial was obsessed with Alexander the Great, but more on that in a moment.
That's it. Alexander wasn't very good at what we might now call empire building.
Alexander's empire is definitely visually impressive, but it wasn't actually much of an empire.
Like Alexander specialized in the tearing down of things, but he wasn't so great at the building up of institutions to replace the things he'd torn down. And that's why pretty soon after his death, his empire broke into three empires called the Hellenistic Kingdoms.
Each was ruled by one of Alexander's generals and they became important dynasties.
The Antigonids in Greece and Macedonia, the Ptolemies in Egypt, the Seleucids in Persia all of which lasted longer than Alexander's empire itself.
A second kind of greatness, maybe Alexander was great because he had an enormous impact on the world after his death. Like King Tut, Alexander the Great was amazingly good at being a dead person. Let's go to the thought bubble.
So after Alexander of Macedon died, everyone from the Romans to Napoleon to Oliver Stone loved him and he was an important military model for many generals throughout history, but his main post-death legacy may be that he introduced the Persian idea of absolute monarchy to the Greco Roman world, which would become a pretty big deal.
Alexander also built a number of cities, on his route, that became big deals after his death and it's easy to spot them because he named most of them after himself and one after his horse.
The Alexandrian Egypt became a major center of learning in the classical world and was home to the most amazing library ever, which Julius Caesar probably accidentally burned down while trying to conquer a bunch of land to emulate his hero, Alexander the Great. Plus, the dead Alexander had a huge impact on culture. He gave the region it's common language,
Greek was so wide spread that archaeologists have found coins in what is now Afghanistan with pictures of their kings, with the word 'King' written beneath the pictures in Greek.
This is also why, incidentally, the New Testament was eventually written in Greek.
Although, Alexander was mostly just conquering territory for the glory and heroism and greatness of it all, in his wake, emerged a more closely connected world that could trade and communicate with more people, more efficiently than ever before.
Alexander didn't make those things happen, but they probably wouldn't have happened without him. But here's a question, if you're watching
Jersey Shore and get so involved in the situations romantic conquest that you leave the bath water running, thereby flooding your apartment and you have to call a plumber and the plumber comes over and you fall in love with him and get married and live happily ever after, does that make the situation responsible for your marriage? Thanks thought bubble.
Okay, a third definition of greatness, maybe Alexander is great because of his legend.
Since no accounts of Alexander were written while he was alive, embellishment was easy and maybe that's where true greatness lies. I mean, the guy died at 32 before he ever had a chance to get old and lose battles. He was tutored by Aristotle, for God's sake.
King Darius who he chased across modern day Iraq and Iran for no real reason, except that he desperately wanted to kill him and when Bessus, one of Darius' generals, assassinated him before Alexander had the chance,
Alexander chased Bessus around until he could at least kill him. These almost comical pursuits of glory and heroism are accompanied in classical histories by stories of Alexander walking through the desert and it's suddenly raining and these ravens are coming to lead him into the army he's supposed to fight. And stories of his hot, Persian wife Roxana, who while still a teenager, engineered the assassination of many of Alexander's fellow wives.
And even in his death, people tried to make Alexander live up to this heroic ideal.
Like Putok tells us that he died of a fever, but that's no way for a masculine, empire building, awesome person to die. So rumors persist that he died either of alcohol poisoning or else of assassination-y poisoning. I mean, no great man can die of a fever.
Ladies, I have to go now because my eyes are stinging from the biological weapon known as Kim Kardashian's gold. Seriously, don't wear it. Best wishes, John Green.
Alexander really came to be great. Millennial after his death, in 1798, Napoleon invaded Egypt, not because he particularly needed to invade Egypt, but because he wanted to do what Alexander had done and long before Napoleon, the Romans really worshiped Alexander.
Particularly the Roman general Pompey, AKA Pompius Magnus, AKA Pompey the Great.
Pompey was so obsessed with Alexander that he literally tried to emulate Alexander's boyishly disheveled hair style.
In short, Alexander is great because others decided he was great, because they chose to admire and emulate him. Yes, Alexander was a great general. Yes, he conquered a lot of land.
Stan, what is Kim Kardashian good at?
Oh. Ah ... I guess just body type then.
Alexander couldn't make history in a vacuum and neither can anyone else. Thanks for watching. I'll see you next week.
John: Hi, I'm John Green. This is Crash Course World History and, today, we're going to discuss, wait for it, the Mongols!
And, if the Mamluks hadn't stopped another of Genghis' grandsons, at the battle of Ain Jalut, they probably would have taken all of North Africa. Man, Genghis Khan sure had a lot of grandkids. Well, it must be time for the open letter.
"It's not like the Mongols had flying horses." EXCEPT THEY DlD. They didn't?
Off-topic but, if that quote rings a bell, it might be because Oliver Stone blatantly plagiarized Genghis Khan in the movie, "Conan The Barbarian." 2.
What I want to do in this video is review all the neat and bizarre things that we have learned about triangles so first we learned So let me just draw a bunch of triangles for ourselves so let's have a triangle right over there the first thing that we talked about is the perpendicular bisectors of the sides of the triangles, so if we take, so let's take let's bisect this side over here, and let's draw a perpendicular line to it, so this line right over here would be the perpendicular bisector of this side right over here, so it's bisecting and it's perpendicular, let's draw another perpendicular bisector right over here, so we're learning that this is the midpoint of that side, let's draw a perpendicular bisector and this length is equal to this length, and then let's do one, let's do one over here, this is the midpoint of that side right over there, and then we will draw a perpendicular - we know that this length is equal to this length right over here, and what we learned is where all these perpendicular bisectors intersect, what's neat about this and frankly, all the things we're going to talk about in this videos is they do intersect in one unique point that one unique point is equidistant from the vertices of this triangle, so this distance is going to be equal to this distance, which is going to be equal to that distance, and because it's equidistant to the vertices, you could draw a circle of that radius that goes through the vertices, so you could draw a circle of that radius that goes through, that goes through the vertices, and that's why we call this right over here, that point, that intersection of the perpendicular bisectors
So I could bisect it like that, and then if I'm bisecting it, this angle is going to be equal to that angle and then if I bisect this one, we know that this angle is going to be equal to that angle over there, and once again, we have proven to ourselves that they all intersect in a unique point, and this point, instead of being equidistant from the vertices, this point is equidistant from the sides of the triangle, so if you drop a perpendicular to each of the sides, this distance is going to be equal to that distance, which is going to be equal to that distance, and because of that, we can draw a circle that is tangent to the side that has this radius, we can draw a circle, we can draw a circle that looks like this, and we call this circle, because it's kind of inside the triangle we call it an incircle, incircle, and this point, we can call, which is the intersection of these angle bisectors, we can call this, we can call this the in-radius, now the other thing we learned about angle bisectors and this was - we just have to draw one- so let me just draw another triangle right over here, and let me draw an angle bisector, so I'm going to bisect this angle, so this angle is equal to that angle, and let me label some points here, so let's say that this is- change the colors, let's say that is A, this is B,this is C, and this is D, we learned that if AC is really the angle bisector of angle BAD, that the ratio between AB over BC, is going to be equal to the ratio
AD to DC, sometimes this is called the angle bisector here, so that- that's neat so the next thing we learned is - let's draw another triangle here, this is to be a full review of everything we've been covering in the last few videos- so let me draw another triangle here- so now, instead of drawing the perpendicular bisectors let me label everything, this is angle bisectors, this is angle bisectors, and now what I'm going to think about are the medians, the medians. So the perpendicular bisectors were lines that bisect the sides, and they are perpendicular, but don't necessarily go through the vertices.
In the last video we saw why when we take any non-zero number divided by zero why mathematicians have left that as being undefined. But it might have raised a question in your brain. What about zero divided by zero?
So for example, you take 0.1 divided by 0.1. Well that's gonna be one. Let's get even closer to zero:
When we perform calculations with a pen and paper we often need to save intermediate results. And we may do this with, say, scrap paper. And in this case the paper is acting as a form of external memory.
And 8 light switches or 8 bits can store 256 unique states. And, 'space' is measured in bits, but the physical size of a bit depends on your method of storage. So how do computers store zero's and one's internally?
"Because a bit can be represented by any bi-stable device, and the magnetic core is a bi-stable device" Later on, this was done using thin film magnetic disks where we can think of each bit as a tiny magnetic cell which can be charged to store either a 1 or a 0. so, long story short, the size of a bit has been rapidly shrinking since the days of punch cards. A hard drive in a modern computer can be thought of as billions of tiny magnetic cells.
And current research at IBM is pushing this to the atomic level - where they have showed 12 iron atoms can work together as a stable magnetic unit. where they are able to store a 1 or a 0, depending how they are oriented. This is approaching a theoretical limit where we would hold a single bit on a single atom!
And interestingly, IBM estimates that we can put around one quadrillion(10^15) bits of information in a hand held device, the size of an Ipod, with atomic storage. And, let's call this a 'super drive', it doesn't even exists yet, as a hypothetical example: A small hand held super drive using atomic storage would hold one thoushand tera bits. which is one thousand trillion switches.
Or, more commonly known as one 125 tera bytes in the palm of your hand. Or, to use an example everyone can understand: 125 tera bytes is the same as having a 1250 killometer long bookshelve in the palm of your hand.
(Birds chirping) This is nice. Listen to that!
And the smell! The fresh grass that we cut last night. What a way to wake up!
Wow!
And that's how I wake up. And that's how every day I think to myself how lucky I am that I wake up. So, earlier this year, the begining of January, i got a call saying,
"Rico would you like to come and talk at TEDxTokyo?" I said, "What am I going to talk about?" "You are going to talk about how to create the perfect morning."
And I didn't know what to say. So I said, "My best thinking I do when I run or I walk." So I started running.
I said, "What are your hobbies?" He said, "I love golf." Me too.
And we played some more golf, and i said, "Why don't you think about, on the train, playing golf?" He said, "Great," and he went out, and every day he thought about his own course.
He would walk that course from tee to green, and every hole he hit a par in his mind, months after months - it's a true story - after three months we played golf, he beat me because he put it in his mind that I am going to be better at what I were yesterday, He put it in his mind to improve himself.
I go to work thinking not, "Oh, I hope so and so will come to serve as my guest," and, " Oh, I hope the delivery man is going to come in because we have a hundred people coming in for lunch today." I go to work knowing that those people will be there.
- I have this wonderful desk, there is nothing on it. Not one piece of paper. Some people come into my office and say,
"Do you work here? You've been here for three years." - "Yes."
He says, "How do you get your employees to smile so much? What's in the food here?"
I said, "There's nothing. People feel good coming to work, and people that don't feel good, they go and do something else. How you create the perfect morning is up to you.
Thank you for your attention! (Applause)

So what I want to try to do is tell a quick story about a 404 page and a lesson that was learned as a result of it. But to start it probably helps to have an understanding of what a 404 page actually is. The 404 page is that.
And those startups are focused on what they are, not what they're not, until one day Athletepath, which is a website that focuses on services for extreme athletes, found this video. (Video) Guy: Joey!
Renny Gleeson: You just ... no, he's not okay. They took that video and they embedded it in their 404 page and it was like a light bulb went off for everybody in the place.
Stayhound, which helps you find pet sitters through your social network, commiserated with your pet. Each one of them found this. It turned into a 24-hour contest.
You can type in an URL and put in a 404 and these will pop. This is one that commiserates with you. This is one that blames you.
Evaluate 1x when x is equal to -1,0,and 1. So let's do the scenario x is equal to 1. So 1x becomes 1 times.. one-which is now negative 1
So really when you value these numbers in x x is equal to -1,0 or1 It's going to equal that number one times anything is going to be that anything right overthere. To make it clear 0 times anything is 0 (0x=0)
We're asked to divide and simplify. And we have one radical expression over another radical expression. The key to simplify this is to realize I have the principal square root of x over the principal root of y, this is the same thing as the principal root of x over y.
And this really comes out of the exponent properties. If I have two things, that I take to the some power, and taking the principal root is the same thing as taking it to the one-half power. If I'm raising them to some power, and then dividing, that's the same thing as dividing first, and then raising them to that power.
Simplify 25 a to the third and a to the third is being raised to the third power, times b squared and all of that over 5 a squared, b times b squared So we can do this in multiple ways, simplify different parts. What I want to do is simplify this part right over here. a to the third power, and we're raising that to the third power.
James and Karlee caught a lizard in their backyard. Its body is 17/8 inches long, and its tail is 10/8 inches long. What is the length of the lizard's body and tail together?
Good morning.
Chris Anderson thinks that we are a bunch of curious souls, and that's why we're here. I think that actually something deeper, more profound is at play. Over the past few decades, the knowledge that individual success is directly related to the society success has grown exponentially.
Where we left off in the last video, in 1924, Hitler was in jail, his famous coup d'ĂŠtat in 1923, his famous Beer Hall Putsched in Munich had failed.
He's now in jail, he's writing Mein Kampf.
When he gets out of jail, so this is when he's in jail, the Nazi party is banned and a lot of the economic turmoil that made the possibility of overthrowing the government more likely, that we saw in the early 20's, that hyperinflation in Weimar Germany, this was now under control by the time Hitler comes out of jail.
To a certain degree the Nazi's and Hitler were starting from scratch, although even at this point
Hitler continues to be an ever growing influence. He's a famous speaker, there are more and more people who are knowing about him and who are following him. Over the next few years his book does get published and it sells, actually, tens of thousands of copies over the next several years, but for the most part he's still a relatively small actor in German politics.
But then we fast forward as we get to the late 20s, the Nazi's are gaining some influence, but then in 1929, (writing) in 1929, you have a global change for the economy of the world and that's the beginning of The Great Depression. In particular, what's often the first sign that The Great Depression was at hand is you have the U.S. stock market crashes in October of 1929, famous Black Tuesday.
That was the mark of the beginning of a, not just American Depression, but a global depression. So you have the whole world going into a depression. Anytime you have economic turmoil it tends give more energy to the more extreme parties, whether it is the parties like the Nazi's, who one could consider maybe to be on the extreme right, or often considered to be on the extreme right, or maybe you could say very nationalistic, or even the extreme
Parliamentary elections and the Parliament in Germany is the Reichstag.
(writing) The Reichstag, and I know I'm mispronouncing it.
In the Reichstag elections, the Nazi party, for the first time is able to have a significant showing. It gets 18, it gets roughly 18% of the vote and a proportional representation in the Parliament.
Now all of a sudden, this kind of marks the beginning of the Nazi's being significant, significant players in German politics. Then we get to 1932 and the economy is not improving, it is only getting worse. (writing) 1932.
Adolf Hitler actually makes a run for President.
The current President at that point is Paul von Hindenburg, famous for the Hindenburg
line, later for the Hindenburg, the Zeppelin, the famous exploding Zeppelin disaster. He was, with Ludendorff, one of the two leaders of the German military effort during World War I. He's President of the Weimar Republic since 1925 and in 1932 he is able to get re-election, but Hitler has a fairly good showing.
Hitler is able to get 35% of the vote. (writing) Hitler gets 35% of the presidential election votes, (writing) of the vote.
The Weimar Republic had this strange system.
It wasn't quite a Presidential system like the U.S. and it wasn't quite a pure Parliamentary system like the current-day Germany. The President was independently elected and had some powers, and then the Parliament was also independently elected and then they would try to build coalitions to have a ruling government.
Needless to say, 1932 Hitler is now a major actor, the Nazi's also have a many, many, many seats in Parliament. Now, you have several Parliamentary elections as well in 1932 and as we just talked about two in particular.
In order for a government to form in Parliament, in order to find the Cabinet and the Chancellor, who essentially is the Prime Minister, you have an election and the different parties get different amounts of votes. If no party has a majority, the parties have to form a coalition that can make a majority. There's a lot of horsetrading going on with parties negotiating, hey why don't we form a coalition with each other, if we do that maybe someone from my party can be
Hindenburg is still President, but Hitler has a good showing and then you have two
Parliamentary elections. (writing) Parliament elections, or Reichstag elections where you have no majority, no coalition.
(writing) no majority, majority coalition.
The Nazi's continue to be a major actor here, they continue to have more and more of a showing inside the Reichstag.
Then by 1933 it's a bit of crisis. So as we get in to early 1933 we have a little bit of a crisis. We have no government, we have no Chancellor, we have no Cabinet to essentially be the executive, the government of the country because there's been no major coalitions.
The Weimar Constitution allowed a strange thing, it allowed the President to appoint a government, appoint a Cabinet, a Chancellor that might not even be representative of what's going on in Parliament.
So, Paul von Hindenburg is convinced that ... hey look, he was no fan, he was no fan of Adolf Hitler but he's convinced that look,
Adolf Hitler was your opponent if you make Adolf Hitler the head of an interim Government, the head of an interim Cabinet then that might be a way to create some national unity and then maybe we could have some Parliamentary elections that there can be a majority coalition and you could have, I guess you could say, a more legitimate government take hold.
So, Paul von Hindenburg is convinced and so he does, even though the Nazi's are still a minority party, even though they weren't part of any type of a majority coalition,
Paul von Hindenburg who is not a fan of Adolf Hitler appoints him as Chancellor. This is in January.
So in January, Hitler, (writing) Hitler is appointed Chancellor,
Chancellor, which is essentially the Prime Minister of the Reichstag of Germany.
Then we get to February and events get really, really, really interesting. In February of 1933 you have a fire in the Reichstag building in Berlin.
 Welcome back. I'm now going to introduce you to the concepts of work and energy.
But then you're wondering, well, I know what a force is, you know, force is mass times acceleration.
But what is energy? And then I looked up energy on Wikipedia and I found this, well, entertaining. But it also I think tells you something that these are just concepts that we use to, I guess, work with what we perceive as motion and force and work and all of these types of things.
So Wikipedia defines energy as the ability to do work. So they kind of use each other to define each other. Ability to do work.
So the definition of work in mechanics, work is equal to force times distance.
So let's say that I have a block and-- let me do it in a different color just because this yellow might be getting tedious. And I apply a force of-- let's say I apply a force of 10 Newtons. And I move that block by applying a force of 10 Newtons.
I have a block of mass m. I have a block of mass m and it starts at rest. And then I apply force.
Well F equals ma.
Or, acceleration is equal to force divided by you mass. So we get vf squared is equal to 2 times the force divided by the mass times the distance. And then we could take the square root of both sides if we want, and we get the final velocity of this block, at this point, is going to be equal to the square root of 2 times force times distance divided by mass.
So, imagine you're standing on a street anywhere in America and a Japanese man comes up to you and says, "Excuse me, what is the name of this block?" And you say, "I'm sorry, well, this is Oak Street, that's Elm Street.
"Excuse me, what is the name of this street?" They say, "Oh, well that's Block 17 and this is Block 16." And you say, "OK, but what is the name of this street?"
If x is a whole number, what other sets does x belong to? And we saw a couple of videos ago that I mentioned that the notion of the set of whole numbers is a little bit ambiguous. Sometimes whole number means non-negative integers.
Integers are-- you know, you could go arbitrarily negative and then negative 3, negative 2, negative 1, 0, 1, 2, 3. And you can just keep going in the positive direction. So if x is a whole number, when they say whole numbers they mean it is non-negative.
In this video we're going to talk about another way of visualizing data called the histogram, which is a very fancy word for a not so fancy thing. I think it's probably fair to say that the histogram is the most used way of representing statistical data. Let me just show you how to figure out a histogram for some data, and I think you're going to get the point pretty easily.

Let's see if we can write 59.2 percent (59.2 %) as a decimal. Well 59.2 percent - this literally means 59.2 per cent - which literally means 59.2 per 100 - which literally means 59.2 per 100 - which is the same thing as 59.2 ÷ 100. If we were to divide 59.2 by 100, what would we get?
We're asked to multiply 5/6 times 2/3 and then simplify our answer. So let's just multiply these two numbers. So we have 5/6 times 2/3.
Find the volume of a sphere with a diameter of 14 centimeters. So if I have a sphere, so this isn't just a circle. This is a sphere.
And, since it already involves pi, and you can approximate pi with 3.14, some people even approximate it with 22/7, but we'll actually just get the calculator out to get the exact value for this volume. So this is going to be... My volume is going to be 4/3...And then I don't want to just put a pi there because that might interprit it as 4 divided by 3 pi.
The beginning of any collaboration starts with a conversation.
FN: Really make a fully integrated product, something beautiful.
YB: And we made a baby. (Laughter)
FN: Can you bring out our baby?
(Applause) This baby is fully electric. It goes 150 miles an hour.
FN: Thank you TED. And thank you Chris, for having us.
We're asked to solve for x. And we have this radical equation. 1 is equal to the principal root or the positive square root of x divided by 3 minus 2.
I love to collect things. Ever since I was a kid, I've had massive collections of random stuff, everything from bizarre hot sauces from all around the world to insects that I've captured and put in jars. Now, it's no secret, because I like collecting things, that I love the Natural History Museum and the collections of animals at the Natural History Museum in dioramas.
This is sort of a self-portrait taxidermy time capsule piece called A Point Just Passed, in which I project myself on top of a time card punch clock, and it's up to you. If you want to choose to punch that punch card clock, you actually age me. So I start as a baby, and then if you punch the clock, you'll actually transform the baby into a toddler, and then from a toddler I'm transformed into a teenager.
So I want to start by offering you a free no-tech life hack, and all it requires of you is this: that you change your posture for two minutes. But before I give it away, I want to ask you to right now do a little audit of your body and what you're doing with your body. So how many of you are sort of making yourselves smaller?
Amy Cuddy: So a handshake, or the lack of a handshake, can have us talking for weeks and weeks and weeks.
Even the BBC and The New York Times. So obviously when we think about nonverbal behavior, or body language -- but we call it nonverbals as social scientists -- it's language, so we think about communication. When we think about communication, we think about interactions.
Jessica Tracy has studied. She shows that people who are born with sight and people who are congenitally blind do this when they win at a physical competition. So when they cross the finish line and they've won, it doesn't matter if they've never seen anyone do it.
I notice that MBA students really exhibit the full range of power nonverbals. So you have people who are like caricatures of alphas, really coming into the room, they get right into the middle of the room before class even starts, like they really want to occupy space. When they sit down, they're sort of spread out.
It's what Marianne LaFrance calls "standing in social quicksand." So this really spikes your cortisol. So this is the job interview we put them through, because we really wanted to see what happened.
"We don't want to hire these people. We also evaluate these people much more positively overall." But what's driving it?
"It feels fake." Right? So I said, fake it till you make it. It's not me.
And the night before my first-year talk, and the first-year talk at Princeton is a 20-minute talk to 20 people. That's it. I was so afraid of being found out the next day that I called her and said, "I'm quitting."
I moved to Harvard, I'm at Harvard, I'm not really thinking about it anymore, but for a long time I had been thinking,
"Not supposed to be here." So at the end of my first year at Harvard, a student who had not talked in class the entire semester, who I had said, "Look, you've gotta participate or else you're going to fail," came into my office.
I really didn't know her at all. She came in totally defeated, and she said,
"I'm not supposed to be here."
And that was the moment for me. Because two things happened. One was that I realized, oh my gosh, I don't feel like that anymore.
In the last video, we talked a little bit about the immune system. In that video, we focused on the nonspecific or the innate immune system.
And even in the nonspecific immune system, we subdivided that into kind of the first line barriers. And those were things like the skin, or the stomach acid, or the acidity of the oils on the outside of your skin. These are just natural barriers to not allowing things inside of your body, but then once they get in-- so you can almost imagine these were the first line of defense.
When someone talks about a white blood cell, they're really just talking about a set of cells that when people first tried to separate the components of blood-- you'd have your red blood cells that would kind of settle in the bottom, then you'd have this layer of white frothy stuff in the middle that was really made of white blood cells, and then on the top, you had the fluid, the plasma from your blood, kind of the watery part. So that's where the name came from, but they have different roles, but they interact with each other.
Now lymphocytes can be divided into B lymphocytes, usually referred to as B cells-- and T lymphocytes.
B lymphocytes were first recognized in the bursa of Fabricius.
That's why it's called B. That's actually a part of birds that participate in the immune system. And so the B came from bursa, but B also applies to the human immune system because it's produced in bone marrow.
It's produced in bone marrow. It's developed in bone marrow, but historically, the B came from the bursa of Fabricius, just in case you want to know. But it's easy to remember.
The B could also stand for bone marrow because that's where it's produced.
T lymphocytes actually do start off in the bone marrow, but they mature and become what they are in the thymus. So that's where the T comes from. Now in this video, I'm going to focus just on the B
But the B lymphocytes frankly on some level-- well, I don't want to pick and choose favorites, but something in my brain-- I just really like the B lymphocytes.
So the B lymphocytes participate in what's called the humoral response.
You'll see that T lymphocytes participate in what's called the cell mediated response and we're going to do that in a future video.
They actually do certain classes of T lymphocytes. We'll see that there are helper T cells and there are cytotoxic T cells. I know it's all very confusing the first time you see it, but that's why I just want to focus on just this part right here.
At first, when a virus comes into my system, it's just floating around in the fluids in my system. The fluids of our system-- that's really what humoral responds to, into the humoral fluids of your body.
These are little viruses floating around. So while they're floating around and they're not sitting inside of cells, that's where the humoral response can come into play. Same thing if we have little bacteria floating around and they haven't infiltrated cells yet.
In the last video, our null hypothesis was the drug had no effect. And our alternative hypothesis was that the drug just has an effect. We didn't say whether the drug would lower the response time or raise the response time.
We just said the drug had an effect, that the mean when you have the drug will not be the same thing as the population mean. And then the null hypothesis says no, your mean with the drug's going to be the same thing as the population mean, it has no effect. In this situation where we're really just testing to see if it had an effect, whether an extreme positive effect, or an extreme negative effect, would have both been considered an effect.
Or that the mean with the drug-- the mean, and maybe I could say the mean with the drug-- is still going to be 1.2 seconds, our mean response time. Now if we wanted to do a one-tailed test, but for some reason we already had maybe a view that this drug would
lower response times, then our alternative hypothesis-- and just so you get familiar with different types of notation, some books or teachers will write the alternative hypothesis as H1, sometimes they write it as H alternative, either one is fine. If you want to do one-tailed test, you could say that the drug lowers response time. Or that the mean with the drug is less than 1.2 seconds.
Now if you do a one-tailed test like this, what we're thinking about is, what we want to look at is, all right, we have our sampling distribution. Actually, I can just use the drawing that I had up here.
You had your sampling distribution of the sample mean. We know what the mean of that was, it's 1.2 seconds, same as the population mean. We were able to estimate its standard deviation using our sample standard deviation, and that was reasonable because it had a sample size of greater than 30, so we can still kind of deal with a normal distribution for the sampling distribution.
So if we look at it-- let me just re-draw it with our new hypothesis test. So this is the sampling distribution.
It has a mean right over here at 1.2 seconds. And the result we got was 3 standard deviations below the mean. 1, 2, 3 standard deviations below the mean.

Hi, I'm John Green and this is Crash Course World History. Let's begin today with a question. Why am I alive?
Uh, Mr. Green, Mr. Green, uh, are you talking about me?
Yes, I'm talking about you, me from the past. I'm telling you that one of the reasons we study history is so that you can be a less terrible boyfriend, but more on that momentarily. [intro music]
No one woke up in the city of Thebe's in Egypt one morning and said, "what a beautiful morning, I sure am living at the height of Egyptian civilization." Still, they're useful constructs, particularly when you're comparing one civilization to another. They're less useful when you're comparing a civilization to a non-civilization type social order, which is why we will try to avoid that.
Whether that's the Tigris and Euphrates, the Yellow River, The Nile, the Amazon Basin, the Coatzacoalcos -
Gaaah! I was doing so good until I got to Coatzacoalcos! (computer says:
Plus, archaeologists have found stuff like bronze in the indus valley that is not native to the region. So what did they trade? Cotton cloth.
You didn't name the federalist papers or the Austro-Hungarian Empire or Adam Smith. But when you do get a chance to name something, you go with THE GREAT BATH? Not the Epic Bath of Mohenjo Daro, or the Bath to End All Baths, or the Pool That Ruled, or the Moist Mystery of Mohenjo
Daro or the Wet Wonder? The Great Bath? Really?
Turns out to be a terrible military strategy not to have any weapons, and it's possible people from the Indus Valley were completely overrun by people from the Caucasus. Two: Environmental Disaster!
The most interesting theory is that a massive earthquake changed the course of the rivers so much that a lot of the tributaries dried up. Without adequate water supplies for irrigation, the cities couldn't sustain themselves, so people literally picked up and headed for greener pastures. Well, probably not pastures, it's unlikely they became nomads.
Also, you're not really helping her by clinging, and from the Indus Valley in the bronze age, to school life today, human life is all about collaboration. Trading cloth for bronze, building cities together, and collaborating to make sure that human lives are tilted to catch the wind. Next week we will travel here to discuss the Hot Mess o" Potamia, but in the meantime, if you have any questions, leave them in comments, and our team of semi-trained semi-professionals will do their best to answer them.
Any economy is a super complicated thing So what I am going to do in this video is a super over simplification. But it is just a way of thinking about things.
Rewrite the equation 6x^2 + 3 = 2x - 6 in standard form and identify a, b, and c. So standard form for a quadratic equation is ax squared plus bx plus c is equal to zero. So essentially you wanna get all of the terms on the left-hand side, and then we want to write them so that we have the x terms...where their exponents are in decreasing order.
 We're asked to factor this expression. And there's going to be simpler ways to factor it, but in this video I'm going to factor it by grouping.
You have actually one coefficient right here, right? t squared is the same thing as 1t squared. So we're looking for two numbers, let's call them a and b, a times b. the product of these two numbers needs to be the product of the coefficient on the t squared, which is 1, and the negative 15 right here.
So a times b has to be equal to 1 times negative 15, or just negative 15.
And the sum of a and b, and a plus b, needs to be equal to negative 2.
And once we have these two numbers, I can show you how we can use those to factor by grouping. And in other videos I've actually broken down to why this technique works. Now, let's think of the different factors of negative 15 when we take their product, and if we take the sum, if we can somehow get to negative 2.
So we could do-- let me do it in this other, let me do it in pink-- see if 1 and negative 15, these are-- so everything I list here, their product is going to be negative 15. But let's think about what happens when you take their sum.
So 1 and negative 15, the sum is negative 14. And if you did negative 1 and 15, you're just going to get the negative of that. You're going to get 14.
It does not equal negative 2. So what happens if you take 3 and negative 5? So their product is definitely negative 15, 3, plus negative 5 is negative 2, so that works.
3 times negative 5 is negative 15, 3 plus negative 5 is negative 2.
So what we want to do here is break this middle term up here.
We know that 3 plus negative 5 is equal to negative 2. So we can break up this middle term here as a sum of-- and I'll do it right here; I'll actually do it in the same color-- so this thing here, we can rewrite as t squared.
I'll put the minus 15 out here.
But the negative 2t we can rewrite as the sum of 3t. We could write it here as plus 3t, minus 5t. And when you're trying to figure out which one to put first or second, you should look at these other terms, and say which ones have common factors?
The 3 and 5 both have a common factor with 15, so it's not as obvious which one to put first, so we're just going to go with this.
3t minus 5t, I got that from 3t minus 5t is equal to negative 2t.
Positive 3 times negative 5 is equal to negative 15. That's where it came from. Now, we're ready to factor by grouping.
So if I factor a t out, that becomes t times-- t squared divided by t is t.
3t divided by t is 3. So these first two terms are the same thing as t times t plus 3. Now, let's look at the second two terms.
Well, they're both divisible by negative 5, so let's factor out a negative 5.
And negative 5t divided by negative 5, if you factor out the negative 5, you're just going to have a t there.
And then negative 15, if you factor out a negative 5, you divide negative 15 by negative 5, you're just going to have a positive 3.
And then notice, you now have two terms here, two products, and they both have the common factor of t plus 3. So we can rewrite this right here as a product of t plus 3.
We're undistributing the t plus 3.
We're factoring out the t plus 3. t plus 3 times t, right?
Times t minus 5. And I want you to really make sure you feel good that these are really the same thing. If you take t times t plus 3 and factor out the t plus 3, you're just left with that t.
If you take negative 5 times t plus 3 and you factor out the t plus 3, you're just left with that negative 5.
But once you factor out the t plus 3, and you're just left with the t minus 5, you have fully factored this expression here. And in the future we're going to see easier ways of doing this, but factoring by grouping is actually the easiest way to do it if you have a coefficient higher than 1, or a non-one coefficient. It could also be a negative coefficient out front here.
I'm here with Walter Isaacson and what are we about to talk about?
We're talking about the Declaration of Independence, which happens, as it says up top, on July 4, 1776, but what we have to remember is that for more than a year, since April 1775 there had been a lot of fighting going on.
(laughing)
Walter:
You know up until they met in Congress with the Continental Congress gathering themselves together they pretended at least to respect George the ill, and they were blaming everything on the British Parliament, but it was a pretty difficult thing to decide you were going to overthrow the King himself.
And just to be clear, this Continental Congress it's easy now for us in hindsight.
Walter: Right, and as you see it says the 13 United States of America.
This is the first time they really start using the phrase United States of America. They weren't really a country yet. They were 13 different colonies, and not all of them wanted to come to this Continental Congress.
They're on the committee that the Congress appoints to draft the Declaration.
Thomas Jefferson only 33 years old, by far the youngest person on the committee and he's chosen to write the first draft.
Then Benjamin Franklin, who is a mentor of Jefferson's, a printer from Philadelphia.
Franklin had just been spending the past two decades almost going back and forth to England to try to prevent a revolution.
Then John Adams, the very passionate sage from the State of Massachusetts who was the one who was most in favor of revolution.
In fact, when Franklin comes back to Philadelphia in early 1776 after having tried to hold Britain and America together most of these people didn't know whether he would be on the side of revolution or not.
In fact, his own son, William Franklin, is, at this time of this Declaration, the Royal Governor of New Jersey and is staying loyal to King George.
And just to, once again emphasize the context, the Royal Governor of New Jersey.
This wasn't like the Governor of New Jersey we imagine now.
He wasn't elected by the people. He was appointed.
Walter: No, he was appointed by the King. He was the Royal Governor, and you know
Franklin was proud of his son, but they have this incredible split starting in 1776 where
William Franklin remains loyal to the crown and loyal to King George the ill who had made him Governor of New Jersey. Now, one thing that you had mentioned a few seconds ago that I think is surprising is when you mentioned that Jefferson was 33 years old when he wrote the Declaration of Independence.
Walter: Yes. They all loved to be thinking of themselves as young rebels too.
Jefferson was a good wordsmith. He was from Virginia and it was very important of this person from ...
Franklin from Pennsylvania and Adams from
Massachusetts to make sure we got Virginia in because Virginia, there was a chance it would remain loyal and ... Male: It was a large wealthy ...
Walter: A large wealthy land-owning colony and so getting the Virginians in, and there were very strong rebels from Virginia.
The Lees of Virginia as well as Jefferson were in favor of declaring independence so they decide they want to make sure that Jefferson gets to write the first draft.
Male: Interesting. And so what we see here, this is the final text.
In the future videos we can talk about previous drafts.
They went through five drafts to get to this draft and this is the one that they do after unaninously all 13 colonies, now called the 13 United States in this document, declare this to be the cause of the colonies.
Walter: Yeah. Male:
"which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth the separate and equal station which the laws of nature and of nature's God entitle them."
What they're saying right there is that the laws of nature and the fact that nature's God created us all equally means that one set of people don't have to be subserviant to or occupied by or colonies of another set of people.
"Laws of nature and nature's God," because this is sort of the beginning of the enlightenment where we're supposed to understand that nature gives us our rights and reasons. John Locke, the great British philosopher, believed in the laws of nature, and these were deists. They kind of were religious a bit, but they didn't subscribe to any particular religious dogma, and so they just talk about nature's God allowing us all to be free and equal.
"A decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to a separation." What they're saying is we care what the rest of you think.
Walter: And by the way, it's directed at one particular people, the French, because we're not going to win this revolution in the United States unless the French help support us. The French, by the way, were already at war with the British.
Walter: Right, right. And it's important for us to remember now too that whenever we do something, whenever we get involved in the world we should have a decent respect to the opinions of mankind.
Walter: That's how we started as a nation saying when we do something we're going to be open. We're going to be honest.
One of the reasons that's most cited as to a cause or the cause of why World War One turned into a world war as opposed to just a regional conflict in Southeast Europe is the alliance system that was developing in the decades leading up to World War One. And to understand that, i've distilled a bunch of the alliances that occurred in those decades leading up to World War One. This is just a distilled version, there are many other alliances that were tangentially related, but I'll try to distill down the ones that were directly related to all of the dominoes falling in 1914, that led to all of Europe being essentially at war with each other.
Really all of these alliances, it's a very healthy debate you can have as to whether these are the direct causes of why one of these powers declared war on the other, or whether these were just excuses, these were kind of a legal pretext for saying "Oh i need to declare war" and in reality they really did want to declare war for a whole set of reasons, to kind of keep the other persons' empire and check, to flex their military muscle, to go after more territory in their empires, who knows what it might be? But needless to say 1839 was a legal basis for the British Empire to protect to protect Belgium.
And then finally in the early nineteen hundreds, 1904 to 1907, you have a series of agreements, "ententes" essentially means "agreements", agreements between the British Empire and France, between the British Empire and the Russian Empire, to essentially get on good terms with each other. These weren't as formally bonding that "Hey, if someone's going to attack you, i'm going to attack them", but they were essentially able to resolve a lot of their issues on what's going on in their other imperial conquest and they formed what is called "The Triple Entente", the triple agreement between Britain, between the British Empire, and right here i just circle the United Kingdom, France
[Instrumental intro of the "I Was Here" song] [Beyoncé, over the music] On August 19, 2012, it's high time we rise together.
In the last video, we saw what a system of equations is. And in this video, I'm going to show you one algebraic technique for solving systems of equations, where you don't have to graph the two lines and try to figure out exactly where they intersect. This will give you an exact algebraic answer.
3 times negative 2 is negative 6y, plus 5y is equal to 20. Add the negative 6y plus the 5y, add those two terms. You have 27-- let's see, this will be-- minus y is equal to 20.
And you're left with negative y is equal to 20 minus 27, is negative 7. And then we can multiply both sides of this equation by negative 1, and we get y is equal to 7. So we found the y value of the point of intersection of these two lines. y is equal to 7.
And you can try it out. Negative 5 plus 2 times 7, that's negative 5 plus 14, that is indeed 9. You do this equation.
Or another way to write it, you could write that as 59 over 2 is the same thing as-- let's see-- 25-- 29.5. y is equal to 29.5. Now, what is x going to be equal to? Well, we already figured out x is equal to y plus 11.
The Eastern and Western fronts, even though they were fronts of the same war, were very different in character. A lot of it came out of the fact of who was fighting it and especially how big the actual fronts were. The Western front, which was generally this region, was a much smaller front than the Eastern front.
Great creativity. In times of need, we need great creativity. Discuss.
"Ford," he called softly. For that was her name.
"Don't say another word, Gusty," she said, for that was his name.
"I know a tent next to a caravan, exactly 300 yards from here. Let's go there and make love. In the tent."
(Music)
(Applause) (Music)
(Applause)
We are asked which of these lines are parallel. So parallel lines are lines that have the same slope, and they're different lines, so they never, ever intersect. So we need to look for different lines that have the exact same slope.
If x goes up by 2, y is going to go up by 6.
2, 4, 6. So this line is going to look something like this. Trying my best to connect the dots.
Negative 4 over negative 2 still a slope of 2, so 1, 2, 3, 4. And I can do that one more time, get right over there. And then you'll see the line.
[UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon] For World Humanitarian Day, we want people all over the world to join together. We want people to do something good, somewhere, for someone else. We want you to make your mark and say:
Ok, let me talk about mathematics. I am sure all of you love math, yeah?
Not so much? Well, I know that not everybody loves math. Honestly speaking, how many of you guys hate math?
Glenn Gould and Yo-Yo Ma and all the other players play the music, so we can get access to beautiful music. But in the world of math, unfortunately, there are great composers; every day a lot of math is created, but no one plays math. So, the world, the beauty of mathematics is only accessible to professional mathematicians.
Su means "numbers"; gaku means "study "of something. So sugaku means "the study of numbers." And I don't think this is a good translation, because it gives the impression that mathematics is actually about numbers.
"ta mathemata."
Ta mathemata means "things we gain by taking", but it's not the taking in the ordinary sense. It's the taking of what we already have. So we usually take something that we don't have, but ta mathemata means things we gain by taking but the taking is the taking of what we already have.
There is a Japanese mathematician called Oka Kiyoshi. I hope everyone will remember his name after this presentation. He used to be in Kyoto.
And Oka was actually so great that some people in Europe thought that Oka was the name of a group. They couldn't believe that he did all this job by himself. Just one single person did all this job.
Oka was not just a great mathematician; but he was also a profound thinker, and philosopher. He has left some great quotes and beautiful essays on the nature of mathematics, In particular, he repeatedly said that mathematics can say nothing of the first number one.
Joocho is a difficult Japanese word.
I was looking for a good translation for it, a good English word that corresponds to Joocho, but unfortunately I was not able to find one. So let's just call this Joocho. (Laughter)
Choose the right number of each place value to make 8129.123.
In the video on the Cambrian explosion I talked about how suprisingly, or somewhat surprisingly animals were the first to colonize or to move on land. They did that before plants did.
So 1.2 billion years ago you have the algae 530 million years ago we have evidence of things kind of oozing out of the ocean and maybe laying their eggs 475 million years ago we have evidence of what we would call "really" plants but the evidence is really the fossils of their spores. And then the first evidence of what you could call real 'animals' that have spent their entire life on the land the oldest fossil we have was discovered in Scotland fairly recently in 2004 and it was... this is the fossil over here, it was discovered by a bus driver, Mike Newman it was a bus driver in Scotland, and they actually named the thing after him. It is called Pneumodesmus newmani, they got the Newmani from Mike Newman and this fossil is 428 million years old 428 million years old and right now it is the oldest fossil we have of a true land animals if we think about true land animals if you think about true plant versus true land animals that spend their entire life on the land if you think about about things that spend part of their time on the land, the the animals would probably the one out if you view algae as plants, then plant were the one out so it depends where you want to draw the line. this first fossil, this is a real myriapode which just means "a lot of legs".
Myriapods. You probably know the word "myriad" that means a bunch of thing or a huge amount, so myriapods - a huge amount of legs. And you might be familiar with the milipedes and centipedes, those are myriopods.
Why is my life the way it is? (Sounds of birds singing and a bell) This world it is the way it is because we are the way we are.
(Bell sound) And we are the way we are because there is Karma
Karma Bond to the Past and Future
(Sound of birds chirping, bells ringing, and a dog barking)
Every morning we wake up to a new day.
but every morning we also wake up to our old life. To the life that we have created.
(forest sounds as the monk walks through it) Last week. Last year
Karma Our Life
(Chanting) Karma is a sanscrit word. It means "action".
Karma Whatever we did.
The Buddhist says "Life is about suffering".
Very often we create suffering. For ourselves or for others. We know that.
Karma We create suffering. We do create suffering around us. This means we fill our own world with suffering.
How can we expect to find anything else in this world other than suffering?
We will find exactly what we had previously provided. We can create our own hell, but we can just as well create heaven.
Karma Heaven or hell.
(People talking, market and traffic sounds)
Wherever we look in this universe, there is cause and effect. Nothing ever happens out of thin air.
This law of cause and effect also applies to our destiny. To the way our life evolves. Whatever we do, whatever we even think will have some effect on our life.
We are constantly shaping our world. And we are shaping our life, little by little. Because for every cause, there must be an effect.
Karma Cause and effect
(Birds chirping) Whatever we do or think shapes our world, a tiny little bit. Be towards greed and anger or be it towards love and kindness.
Karma We shape our world. So our actions directly affect our world. Our own as well as other people's world.
Karma All is one (Birds continue chirping.
(Birds chirping and men chanting) Our present life is created by our Karma We cannot escape it.
Since we have created suffering in the past, there will be future suffering too. The future is just the echo of our past actions. For a long time, we have been filling the world around us with our anger and greed.
Karma Suffering creates suffering. So, is there a way of actually prevent future suffering?
Yes, there is. Our past unwholesome Karma is like a drop of dirty water on the bottom of a big jar. It is there.
Karma Drop by drop. Since we cannot get rid of our unwholesome Karma, we need to dilute and thereby neutralize it. Rather than creating new suffering again and again, we need to prevent suffering.
Karma Control instead of suffering.
Our Karma is the bond that ties us to past suffering and that will create future suffering too.
If we want to be free, we need to cut this bond. We need to prevent the creation of new suffering. So our life can be better next week, next year, next life.
Karma It is up to us
Everything wholesome. Nothing unwholesome. A Pure mind.
A film by Jorg Dittmar Spiritual Guidance Pra Acham Tippakorn Sukhito Production Manager Mae Chee Brigitte Schrottenbacher
Once again we have three identical objects they all have the same mass, but we don't know what the mass is. But we do know that if you total up their mass, it is the same exact mass as these nine objects. and each of these 9 masses have a mass of exactly 1 kilogram. So we have a total of 9 kg on this side, and over here we have 3 objects that all have the same mass but we don't know what that mass is, we are just calling that mass 'X'.
Over here, we have 3 thing with mass 'X' so their total mass we could write as X + X + X
I we want, we could say: "If have an X plus another X plus another X, I have 3 X's." So I could re-write this as 3X and 3X will be equal to...
[silence] When we did it the last time, with the scales, we said "We have 3 of these X's here.
We want to have just 1 X here,"
So we could say "whatever this X is, if the scales stay balanced, It will be the same as what we have there." There might be a temptation to subtract 2 of the X's from this side, but that will not help us, we can even see that mathematically over here, if we subtracted 2 X's from both sides, on the left-hand side we would have 3x - 2x, and on the right you would have 9 - 2x
We said "what if we took a third of these things?" If we take 1/3 of these things and we take 1/3 of those things, we should still get the same mass on both sides because the original things had the same mass. The equivalent of doing this mathematically is to say
"Why don't we multiply both sides by one-third?" Or another way to say it is "we can divide both sides by three" Multiplying by 1/3 is the same thing as dividing by 3.
-- so you divide by 3 - you have an X is equal to 1 + 1 + 1. X = 3.
Or you see here that X = 3. 1/3 * 3 = 1 and you're left with one X so you are left with X = 9 * 1/3, or you can do 9 divided by 3, which is equal to 3.
Let's imagine that this is you, and you are headed home for the holidays. So you board a plane. And you notice, while you're on this plane, that the people around you are pretty sick.
And it leads to approximately 200,000 hospitalizations every year, due to complications of influenza infections. In addition to the 200,000 hospitalizations that we have every year in this country, approximately 20 to 40 thousand people die every single year. 20,000 to 40,000 deaths on an annual basis.
The modern influenza vaccine is approximately 70% effective in preventing influenza infection. And so this is a great way to help prevent illness and death.
Shelagh and Luana realize that they could express their ages more specifically if they used fractions. Doing this will allow them to calculate the difference in their ages more precisely.
If Shelagh describes her age as 15 and 1/2 years old and
Luana is 7 and 7/12-- I'm assuming years old-- what is the difference in their ages? Write the answer as a simplified mixed number. So Shelagh is older, so she's 15 and 1/2 years old, so we
We're still going to-- sorry, let's write both of them as improper fractions, so we're going to keep 2 in the denominator. And as an improper fraction, 2 times 15 is 30 plus 1 is 31. So 31/2 the same thing as 15 and 1/2, so these are equivalent.
The difference between Shelagh and Luana's age is 7 and 11/12, or Shelagh is 7 and 11/12 years older than Luana.
(Music)
(Applause) Thank you. Imagining a solo cello concert, one would most likely think of Johann Sebastian Bach unaccompanied cello suites.
Bach's music would intermingle with the singing voices of Muslim prayers from the neighboring Arab village of the northern Kibbutz in Israel where I grew up. Late at night, after hours of practicing,
I would listen to Janis Joplin and Billie Holiday as the sounds of tango music would be creeping from my parents' stereo. It all became music to me. I didn't hear the boundaries.
I still start every day practicing playing Bach. His music never ceases to sound fresh and surprising to me. But as I was moving away from the traditional classical repertoire and trying to find new ways of musical expression,

What fraction of this circle is shaded red ? So you see this circle is divided into one..two..three..four..five ..six.. seven..eight equal parts and of those eight equal parts, seven are shaded red. So we can say that seven out of eight, are shaded red.
 Use the line segments below to create a quadrilateral, so a four-sided figure, with vertices at the following points. So they give us four coordinates right over here.
We can later rearrange it to see what actually makes sense.
So 8, negative 7 Is right over here. It feels like this might be the right edge.
So I'll put its other point right at 8, negative 7. And then finally, 8 comma 0. Well, 8 comma 0 Is right over here.
From Kenya to Columbia, from Iraq to Korea, in slums, in schools, in prisons and in theatres, every day, people gather at TEDx events around the world to hear the best ideas bubbling up in their communities. Today, you are part of a global conversation about our shared future. So what is this TEDx?
TEDx is an initiative of the TED conference, a nonprofit devoted to ideas worth spreading.
We grant free licences to allow TED-like events to spread globally. This event today is based on the TED conference format and ideals but is independently organised by your local community. So please make sure to thank the team of volunteers who worked so hard on today's event.
One of the most powerful methods that we have for monitoring the well being of a child is a tool called growth monitoring.
Maybe they are unable to digest the nutrients or they are unable to absorb them, but for some reason the nutrients aren't getting to the tissues to help the body grow. The other kind of failure to thrive is called non-organic failure to thrive. The leading cause of non-organic failure to thrive is malnutrition due to poverty.
If x-- and the operator here is this x with a circle around it, so maybe we'll call it circle-x. If x circle-x y is equal to x plus 3y, and x-- I'll call that circle-plus.
Diya is looking to buy a plot of land to build her home on. She finally narrows her search to two plots that both have good locations. The plot at 314159 Apple Lane has a width of 30 meters and a length of 40 meters.
So it's pretty clear when you calculate the area that Apple Lane, you are getting more square meters than you would get at Fibonacci Drive. And literally when we say 1200 square meters, that means if you would have put a 1 meter by 1 meter square here, so really small like that, that you could fit 1200 of these on this plot of land while you could only fit a 1000 of them on this plot of land, these 1 meter by 1 meter squares. So we have a larger area, same neighborhood or comparable neighborhood for the same price.
So we have this bar chart here. This says Scores on Midterm and Final Exams. So this axis, the vertical axis, is the scores.
 We're told to find the x- and y-intercepts for the graph of this equation:
2 y plus 1/3x is equal to 12. And just as a bit of a refresher, the x-intercept is the point on the graph that intersects the x-axis.
So we're not above or below the x-axis, so our y value must be equal to 0.
And by the exact same argument, the y-intercept occurs when we're not to the right or the left of the y-axis, so that's when x is equal to 0.
So let's set each of these values to 0 and then solve for what the other one has to be at that point. So for the x-intercept, when y is equal to 0, let's solve this. So we get 2 times 0, plus 1/3x is equal to 12.
I put 0 for y. Well, anything times 0 is just 0, so you're just left with 1/3x is equal to 12. To solve for x, you can think of it as either dividing both sides by 1/3, or we can multiply both sides by the reciprocal of 1/3.
And so we're left with 3 times 1/3, that just cancels out, so you're left with x is equal to 12 times 3, or x is equal to 36. So when y is equal to 0, x is 36. So the point 36 comma 0 is on the graph of this equation.
Please close your eyes, and open your hands. Now imagine what you could place in your hands: an apple, maybe your wallet. Now open your eyes.
But that hospital was over four hours away, and Sevitha didn't have the means to get there, so her baby died. Inspired by this story, and dozens of other similar stories like this, my team and I realized what was needed was a local solution, something that could work without electricity, that was simple enough for a mother or a midwife to use, given that the majority of births still take place in the home. We needed something that was portable, something that could be sterilized and reused across multiple babies and something ultra-low-cost, compared to the 20,000 dollars that an incubator in the U.S. costs.
And we can save millions of lives through the simple warmth of an Embrace.
What I wanna do in this video is get ourselves a little bit more comfortable with the idea of strings. And also see the power of strings, and all the things we can do to them. or do with them. So what I'm gonna do up here is
let's call it "My first test string".
"My first test string"— right over there. As you know, a string is just a big sequence of characters right over here and you could recognize them because they'll either be in single or double quotation marks (' or "). And just to make clear that it doesn't have to be double ("),
'Another test string that I have defined' And just to clarify on how you can define strings, you can actually put— quotations within the quotation marks as long as it's clear where the string begins and ends. So let's say you have something like this:
So let's say you say "This is Sal's string" So in this example, this apostrophe is okay— it's a single quotation (') but it's okay because the interpreter will know that, "Look, the string starts with a double quote (") so I have to look for another double quote (") for it to end."
'This is Sal's string' This doesn't make any sense, because here, we're opening with a single quotation, then it'll close right when we get to the next [single] quotation, and so all of this [s string'] is just gonna be some text that the interpreter is going to try to view as some type of program, and it's going to break on that. So if you want this to work, you can't have it like that.
'Sal's—no, you can't do that—
So 'My favorite... and there are ways to do that and we're not gonna go into escape characters and all of that right now, but, 'My favorite word is... and actually I don't know what my favorite word is,
But let's say 'My favorite word is "asparagus"... As...I can't even spell it. As...asparagus.
So 'My favorite word is "aspara[g]us", what is yours?' So once again this is legitimate because I start my string with a single quotation mark, so it says,
"Look, let's not end the string until we get to another single quotation mark." So it's not like it'll confuse the interpreter when it sees this first double quotation 'cause it knows that the string started with a single quotation.
"a", 'My first test string'
"b", 'Another test string that I have defined,'
"c", "This is Sal's string"
"d", 'My favorite word is... "aspara...
"asparaus"... I couldn't even spell "asparagus" properly, maybe we'll have to fix that. ..."asparaus", what is yours?'
That needs a "g", asparaGus! ...What is yours?' And then we have— it's a good thing this isn't the spelling video— we can look at what math_string looks like, math_string, it's literally that string of characters. And then we have the expression string.
And there we could use the built-in Python function len() which is short for length.
So the len() of a [len(a)], it says, "Hey, there's twenty character in a!" Let's count it, let's verify it. 1, 2, space (' ') is a character, [counting to twenty]
len(), length for short. math_string is five characters. Let's count 'em. 1 2 3 4 5 characters.
'Another test string that I have defined' When I took a+b, it took a, "My first test string," and it added b to the end of it!
It concatenated b to a— concatenate is just a fancy word for "put 'em together!" 'Another test string that I have defined,' so it merged a— I guess you could view it, it put b at the end of a.
So maybe I'm writing some type of program, and I wanna take this string that's in b and I want to put each of these words as a separate element in a list. So what I can do is, I can say b dot (b.) and I'll call one of the methods of b and we'll do much more on methods and object-oriented progamming and all of that, but we can view b as a string object, and it has its own methods and can operate on itself. For now you can just say,
So notice: every time there was a 't', it split the string there and it put whatever was on each side of those 't's, and put them into a separate element in this list over here. So a very fascinating thing, you can do things like... finding where a character is in a string. So let's say you wanna call—I don't know—
I want to find that asterisk (another word I have trouble saying). So find() the asterisk. Tell me which character, if any, has an asterisk in it.
"Look, let's take c and let's replace... and you can either look it up in a book, or just do a web search, you can normally find all of the libraries for Python strings, or if you have an IDE, it'll suggest things that you can do to strings and how you do it. But let's say we want to replace, in string c, all of the 'i's with 'o's. Let's see what we get.
So there you go, it was "This is Sal's string," and it replaced it with 'o's, and I want to be clear; it didn't change string c! It created a copy of c with the 'i's replaced by 'o's. So then it became "Thos os Sal's strong."
And that's the eval() function. And it exists in interpretative languages like Python (and it also exists in JavaScript) and what's really cool is, is it can evaluate a string. It can view a string, you can treat it as a string for a while and you can construct it, so you could, for example, have a computer program that writes another computer program inside a string and then evaluates that computer program.
"Okay, now let me treat that like a program," so it's "3+4*2", order of operations, does the 4*2 first so that's 8. 3 + 8 is 11. And you can do even cooler things!
Well, what it did is, math_string is this stuff but if you add a 1 to it, it would look like that [3+4*21], the 2 would become a 21, we're concatenating a 1 to the end of it. So it became 4*21 which is 84, +3 which is 87. And you can do other things, we can evaluate this expression_string right over here, that's why I set it up like that. eval(expression_string)
Really fun to play with, I could do this all day! eval(expression_string) Remember, expression_string is just a string, but when we evaluate it, you might want to pause and think what you're going to get.
Well, in the string, these were just characters, 'a' and 'b' but when I evaluated it in our current context, a and b are variables and they represent strings.
So when you evaluate this thing, it's gonna say, "Okay, a is a string, it's 'My first text string,' concatenate or put this space at the end of it".
So, "My first test string" and then I have a space, and then, put b at the end of that, so "Another test string that I have defined," then put... then put a... SPACE TlGER and then you have a space tiger. So I'm gonna leave you there... as you can imagine, strings are a super super duper powerful concepts for doing a bunch of applications.
Life is about opportunities, creating them and embracing them, and for me, that was the Olympic dream. That's what defined me. That was my bliss.
Where was I? What was happening? My body was consumed by pain.
For over 10 days, I drifted between two dimensions. I had an awareness of being in my body, but also being out of my body, somewhere else, watching from above as if it was happening to someone else.
Why would I want to go back to a body that was so broken? But this voice kept calling me: "Come on, stay with me."
"No. It's too hard."
"Come on. This is our opportunity."
"No. That body is broken. It can no longer serve me."
"Come on. Stay with me. We can do it.
The vertebra at L1 was like you'd dropped a peanut, stepped on it, smashed it into thousands of pieces. They'd have to operate. They went in.
L1, they rebuilt it, they took out another broken rib, they fused T12, L1 and L2 together. Then they stitched me up. They took an entire hour to stitch me up.
"Janine, the operation was a success, and we've picked as much bone out of your spinal cord as we could, but the damage is permanent. The central nervous system nerves, there is no cure. You're what we call a partial paraplegic, and you'll have all of the injuries that go along with that.
They moved me from intensive care to acute spinal. I was lying on a thin, hard spinal bed. I had no movement in my legs.
"Start threading them together." Well, there wasn't much else to do in the spinal ward, so we did. And when we'd finished, he went around silently and he joined all of the straws up till it looped around the whole ward, and then he said,
"Okay, everybody, hold on to your straws." And we did. And he said, "Right.
After six months, it was time to go home. I remember Dad pushing me outside in my wheelchair, wrapped in a plaster body cast, and feeling the sun on my face for the first time. I soaked it up and I thought, how could I ever have taken this for granted?
But before I left the hospital, the head nurse had said to me, "Janine, I want you to be ready, because when you get home, something's going to happen." And I said, "What?" And she said,
"You're going to get depressed."
And I said, "Not me, not Janine the Machine," which was my nickname. She said, "You are, because, see, it happens to everyone. In the spinal ward, that's normal.
Maria was in a car accident, and she woke up on her 16th birthday to the news that she was a complete quadriplegic, had no movement from the neck down, had damage to her vocal chords, and she couldn't talk. They told me, "We're going to move you next to her because we think it will be good for her." I was worried.
And I started to ask, "Why not me?" And then I thought to myself, maybe being at rock bottom is actually the perfect place to start. I had never before thought of myself as a creative person.
Sitting at home in my wheelchair and my plaster body cast, an airplane flew overhead, and I looked up, and I thought to myself, "That's it!
If I can't walk, then I might as well fly." I said, "Mom, I'm going to learn how to fly."
She said, "That's nice, dear." (Laughter)
I said, "Pass me the yellow pages." She passed me the phone book, I rang up the flying school,
I made a booking, said I'd like to make a booking to come out for a flight.
They said, "You know, when do you want to come out?"
I said, "Well, I have to get a friend to drive me out because I can't drive. Sort of can't walk either. Is that a problem?"
I said, "Hi, I'm here for a flying lesson." And they took one look and ran out the back to draw short straws.
"You get her."No, no, you take her." Finally this guy comes out. He goes,
"Hi, I'm Andrew, and I'm going to take you flying."
I go, "Great." And so they drive me down, they get me out on the tarmac, and there was this red, white and blue airplane. It was beautiful. They lifted me into the cockpit.
I'm going, "Wow, how do you ever know what all these buttons and dials do?" Andrew the instructor got in the front, started the airplane up. He said, "Would you like to have a go at taxiing?"
I said, "No, I can't use my legs."
He went, "Oh."
I said, "But I can use my hands," and he said, "Okay." So he got over to the runway, and he applied the power. And as we took off down the runway, and the wheels lifted up off the tarmac, and we became airborne,
And Andrew said to me, as we got over the training area,
"You see that mountain over there?"
And I said, "Yeah."
And he said, "Well, you take the controls, and you fly towards that mountain." And as I looked up, I realized that he was pointing towards the Blue Mountains where the journey had begun. And I took the controls, and I was flying.
"Oh, who is she kidding? She's never going to be able to do this." And sometimes I thought that too.
The philosopher Lao Tzu once said,
"When you let go of what you are, you become what you might be." I now know that it wasn't until I let go of who I thought I was that I was able to create a completely new life. It wasn't until I let go of the life I thought I should have that I was able to embrace the life that was waiting for me.
Ever since the franco-prusian war in 1870 to 1871 the Germans recognized that they were likely to face another war with france. That was a war that allowed Germany to unify the humiliated France, they were able to capture some very valuable territory from France, in particular Alsace-Lorraine, which is very mineral rich, and so the Germans were plotting to uh... what are we going to do if we're going to get into another war with them. At the same time, once France and Russia had this alliance,
Schleiff.. Schliff... ..Schlieffen plan, named for Alfred von Schlieffen, he was chief of the German Empire's general staff from 1891 to 1905. And it was based on how do you deal with the two-front war, and the general ideas here were that Russia...
Express the area of a rectangle with length 4y and width 2y as a monomial. So the area of a rectangle is just the width times the height. Or, the base times the height (base x height)
 Created by the hottest, most violent, and most energetic objects and events in the Universe, gamma rays travel across vast stretches of space, only to be absorbed by Earth's atmosphere. Scientists had no way to detect and study gamma rays from the cosmos until high altitude balloons and rockets carried gamma ray sensors above the atmosphere.
The gamma ray spectrometer on NASA's Mars Odyssey Orbiter detects and maps these signatures, such as this map of hydrogen concentrations. Gamma rays stream from stars, supernovas, black holes, and pulsars to wash our sky with gamma ray light.
NASA's Fermi gamma ray telescope imaged the
location of these sources, mapping out the Milky Way galaxy by creating a full 360 degree view of the Galaxy from our perspective here on Earth. While the visible light sky is predictable and follows regular patterns, the gamma ray sky does not. Bursts of high-energy gamma radiation arrive from deep space every day.
Gamma ray bursts are the most energetic and luminous electromagnetic events since the Big Bang and can release more energy in 10 seconds than our Sun will emit in its entire 10 billion-year expected lifetime. NASA's SWlFT satellite recorded this gamma ray burst of an exploding star 13 billion light years away.
You know, what I do is write for children, and I'm probably America's most widely read children's author, in fact. And I always tell people that I don't want to show up looking like a scientist. You can have me as a farmer, or in leathers, and no one has ever chose farmer.
My circle began back in the '60s in high school in Stow, Ohio where I was the class queer. I was the guy beaten up bloody every week in the boys' room, until one teacher saved my life. She saved my life by letting me go to the bathroom in the teachers' lounge.
I got a phone call in the middle of the night from that teacher, Mrs. Posten, who said, "I need to see you. I'm disappointed that we never got to know each other as adults. Could you please come to Ohio, and please bring that man that I know you have found by now.
We grew up interacting with the physical objects around us. There are an enormous number of them that we use every day. Unlike most of our computing devices, these objects are much more fun to use.
A gesture of "Namaste!", maybe, to respect someone, or maybe, in India I don't need to teach a kid that this means "four runs" in cricket. It comes as a part of our everyday learning.
"What is Dr. Smith's address?" and this small system actually prints it out -- so it actually acts like a paper input-output system, just made out of paper. In another exploration, I thought of making a pen that can draw in three dimensions.
I started thinking, "Why can I not take this approach in the reverse way?"
Maybe, "How about I take my digital world and paint the physical world with that digital information?" Because pixels are actually, right now, confined in these rectangular devices that fit in our pockets. Why can I not remove this confine and take that to my everyday objects, everyday life so that I don't need to learn the new language for interacting with those pixels?
The camera is actually not only understanding your hand movements, but, interestingly, is also able to understand what objects you are holding in your hand. For example, in this case, the book cover is matched with so many thousands, or maybe millions of books online, and checking out which book it is. Once it has that information, it finds out more reviews about that, or maybe New York Times has a sound overview on that, so you can actually hear, on a physical book, a review as sound.
I would say you're truly one of the two or three best inventors in the world right now. It's an honor to have you at TED. Thank you so much.
Evaluate 0 plus y plus -7 when y is equal to -3 and y is equal to 0 and y is equal to 7. So let's take the first situation where y is equal to -3... Then this expression right here would be... 0 plus -3 (because that's our "y" now) plus -7.
-3 plus -7 Now we could draw a number line here, just to help us visualize it But even if we didn't have the number line, we could say "Look, we're already 3 below zero...
We're starting at -3, and to that we're adding -7 So we're starting at -3, the absolute value is -3[sic] is our starting point. To that we're adding another negative 7
The absolute value of -7 is equal to 7... that's the length of this arrow. But we're moving it to the left. The abolsute value of this arrow right here (the absolute value of negative 3) is 3.
So if your signs are the same, you can just take the absolute value of them say "ok, that's how far we're going to move, total. and we're that far from zero to the left" So the answer here is -10 That was when y is -3.
It's just going to be equal to -7 Now let's do the last one (when y is equal to 7) It's going to be 0 plus (our y is equal to 7) so 0 plus 7 and then we have plus -7
Plus -7 is the same thing as subtracting a 7 The zero doesn't matter, so this is equal to 7 minus 7... which is equal to zero! Another way to think about it...

Thank you. Can I ask everybody, please, to put down your pens and pencils and those of you upstairs to close your electronics and join me in silence?
Thank you. So how did that feel? For some of you, I suspect, on this talky-talky day, with lots of information coming at you, there was a bit of a "Ah, thank you!"
But for others of you, I suspect, there was some discomfort. I won't make you raise your hands but how many of you wondered if she was just going to stand up there for the entire time of her talk? (Laughter)
Margaret Wheatley, in her wonderful book "Turning to one another: simple conversations to restore hope to the future," says that she suspects that the noisiness of our world today is because people are desperate to be heard. That we are, in fact, clamoring to be heard. I mean, have you ever been around a small child when you were busy and they wanted your attention?
"Hey... Hey! Hey!"
- for some of you that's the luxury, right? - and quiet, leave the quiet. And when you go outside to be healthy, do one more healthy thing for yourself and take the earphones out, and listen to the world around you, to your heart beat, and your own breath. And your thoughts.
Where do you have - Margaret Wheatley also asks in her book- when have you experienced good listening? If you've had the great gift of having someone listen to you well, it is probably because they were comfortable with silence. Most of us when we're in a conversation, the way we work is that you're talking to me, and I am thinking about how I'm going to connect with you, what am I going to say where my story is like yours, different than yours, worse or better than yours.
This may be the toughest one of all. Outside of our faith communities we rarely practice silence in a group, do we? In a place like this?
Back to Margaret Wheatley's comment, our world has gotten so loud, that perhaps the reason that we're plugging in,
- as Steve talked about - is to shut out that discord. But in fact what we need to do is let it in, and really listen, and understand. And so my challenge to you today, my big bold thought is can you go home and practice silence?
Everyone needs a coach. It doesn't matter whether you're a basketball player, a tennis player, a gymnast or a bridge player. (Laughter)
The U.S. isn't number one. We're not even in the top 10.
We're tied for 15th with Iceland and Poland. Now, out of all the places that do better than the U.S. in reading, how many of them have a formal system for helping teachers improve? Eleven out of 14.
Well, to find out, our foundation has been working with 3,000 teachers in districts across the country on a project called Measures of Effective Teaching. We had observers watch videos of teachers in the classroom and rate how they did on a range of practices. For example, did they ask their students challenging questions?
"Do you learn to correct your mistakes?" And what we found is very exciting. First, the teachers who did well on these observations had far better student outcomes.
I am a high school English teacher at Johnston High School in Johnston, Iowa. Turn to somebody next to you. Tell them what you think I mean when I talk about moves to prove.
One day, we'd like every classroom in America to look something like that.
Hi, I'm John Green, this is Crash Course World History, and today we're going to be discussing trade here, in the Indian Ocean. How'd my handwriting get so good? Oh, my globe had a globe!
King Charles VI of France believed that he was made out of glass, relentlessly focusing on the actions of the Funny Hatted who ruled us makes us forget that we also make history.Mr. Green, Mr. Green!
Did Charles VI of France really believe that he was made out of glass? Yes, he did, but today we're talking about Indian Ocean trade and it's going to be interesting, I promise. So pay attention.
This is a classroom, not a Truman Capote beach party. [music intro] [music intro]
Like the "Neptunian Network"? No.
"The Wet Web"? No, that's definitely not it. "The Sexy Sea Lanes of South Asia"?
It then declined a bit during the Pax Mongolica, when overland trade became cheap and safe, because--- wait for it--- The Mongols. But then the Indian Ocean trade surged again in the 14th and 15th centuries.
Swahili coast cities, Islamic empires in the Middle East, India, China, Southeast Asia, and NOT EUROPE, which is probably one of the reasons that Monsoon Marketplace isn't as famous as it should be.
Oh, Stan. I don't want to say it but I have to;
That really took guts, Kota Rani! Sorry... And all this because your father welcomed an army into your house thinking they were merchants.
The Swahili city states imported finished goods such as silk and porcelain from China and cotton cloth from India. Spices and foodstuffs like rice were shipped from Southeast Asia and especially Sri Lanka where black pepper was a primary export good, and the Islamic world provided everything from coffee to books and weapons. But it wasn't just products that made their way around the eastern hemisphere thanks to the Indian Ocean.
Srivijaya rose up on Sumatra. And for a while, Srivijaya dominated trade in the region, because there were so many ships going through the Strait of Melaka going to and from China. But, as we'll see in another episode that this trade abruptly declined in the 15th century.
And with it, so did Srivijaya. This brings up a key point about Indian Ocean Trade: which is that it was indispensable to the creation of certain city states, like Srivijaya and the city states of the Swahili Coast.
If you want to suggest future phrases of the week or guess at this week's you can do so in comments where you can also ask questions related to today's video that will be answered by our team of historians. Thanks for watching. and as we say in my hometown, don't forget to remain resolute and resourceful in an atmosphere of extreme pessimism.. Oh!
Let's say we're going to shoot some object into the air at an angle. Let's say its speed is s and the angle at which we shoot it, the angle above the horizontal is theta. What I want to do in this video is figure out how far this object is going to travel as a function of the angle and as a function of the speed, but we're going to assume that we're given the speed.
Now whenever you do any problem like this where you're shooting something off at an angle, the best first step is to break down that vector. Remember, a vector is something that has magnitude and direction. The magnitude is s.
And this tells us that sine is opposite over hypotenuse, cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse and tangent is opposite over adjacent. So let's see what we can do. We're assuming we know theta, we know s.
And we know in the vertical direction-- let me do that in the vertical direction, the magnitude is s sine of theta. It is s sine of theta. So now that we've broken up into the two components, we're ready to figure out how long we're going to be in the air.
PROBLEM: "Simplify the expression 28(b to the 6th) divided by 7b." (b to the 6th == b^6) Well, this is the same thing as 28 over 7 times b^6 over b.
Let's think about what might happen in the United States, if the dollar is allowed to weaken relative to the yuan. So, the most obvious thing is that Chinese imports will become more expensive. [Chinese imports will become more expensive].
It could step in, it could continue to print more money and essentially could keep debt cheap. It doesn't look as good optically. Now, the last and probably most important question is to some degree, once again not a clear cut answer.
This is Salman Khan of the KhanAcademy for CNBC.
We're asked to simplify 8 plus 5 times 4 minus, and then in parentheses, 6 plus 10 divided by 2 plus 44. Whenever you see some type of crazy expression like this where you have parentheses and addition and subtraction and division, you always want to keep the order of operations in mind. Let me write them down over here.
Let's draw a diagram of the human breast and talk about some of the amazing functions of this organ. Now, the human breasts in both males and females contains mammary glands. And in females, around the time of puberty, these mammary glands develop; in males, they usually remain remain undeveloped and the main function of this gland,
Now these mammary glands, each of them drains towards the nipple by a little duct called the lactiferous duct and I remember I was expecting my first baby and I remembered thinking,
"Where is the milk gonna come out from? I don't see a hole there!" And the answer is, there isn't a single hole there.
And so these lactiferous ducts, and I'll just label them for you here, these are the
lactiferous ducts and the lactiferous ducts empty, or drain, towards the nipple and towards that darker area of skin that we see when we look at the human breast and that area of skin is called the areola and the reason the areola exist is because when the newborn first comes out, areola, the newborns actually don't see very well and in order to help them find their source of food, we have this darkened area of the breast that actually gets quite a bit darker during pregnancy.
Ok, so now these mammary glands are lined with what we called myoepithelial cells and let me just break down that word for you.
"Myo" is-is a prefix that we use when we're talking about anything that has to do with muscles. or anything that contracts. So these are we know contractile cells and they're also epithelial cells and epithelial cells in the body are the cells that line things.
So these cells, these red ones, these myoepithelial cells are cells that both line the mammary glands and have the ability to contract, to eject the milk out through the lactiferous ducts.
Now all of these structures are supported by quite a bit of connective tissue and we're usually talking about in the breast.
The main ones are collagen and elastin collagen... and... elastin
And all of these connective tissue kind of this connective tissues framework, comes together in these ligaments, strong ligaments, that anchor the breasts to the chest wall and these ligaments are called Cooper's ligaments. Cooper's...
In medical school, we used to remember this by saying the phrase, "Cooper's Droopers" but after having had 3 children and breastfed for a long time, I don't think that's so funny anymore. Anyway, the only other thing in the breast that makes it kind of a soft and squishy organ is the adipose tissue that also sort of forms part of the framework or the structure and supports actually all of the glands along with the connective tissue, the collagen and elastin.
So this is our adipose tissue adipose... and, we'll see in our next video what happens how the body knows when to cause the these myoepithelial cells to contract, to eject the milk out of the mammary glands.
Danny: The lemonade stand is a very good analogy; you have to be where the people are. No matter how beautiful and cool and neat your lemonade stand is, if there aren't any people around, you're not going to do very well.
This is Steven Zucker and Juliana Kreinik. And we are talking about the "twittering machine" by Paul Klee. - Or "Zwitschermaschine".
And I am thinking of this because Klee is swiss, and I am thinking of this because it is turning and there is birds, so I am thinking of a cuckoo clock - You are absolutely right. - Do you think he was maybe creating this sort of inner workings of of the cuckoo clock deconstructed and sort of turned in on its head?
- Yeh, and you know some of the others would be like "qwah qwah qwah" and you know you could sort of imagine all of this happening all at once. - I think that's right. And you could also imagine sort of the chaos visually of how this would look if you'd pull the handle because each bird is perched on sort of a wire that sort of archs in space.
Find the range and the midrange of the following sets of numbers So what the range tells us is essentially how spread apart these numbers are And the way that you calculate it is
We're given a bunch of lines here that intersect in all different ways and form triangles. And what I want to do in this video, We've been given the measures of some of the angles.
And X plus 92 plus 29 is equal to 180 degrees. And X plus 92 plus 29 is going to be 121 degrees. We already knew that before.
And so that is going to equal 180 degrees.
So X is equal to 59 degrees. So there is a ton of ways that you could've thought about this problem.
Who invented writing? Human beings have probably been speaking to each other for tens of thousands of years, but we've only been writing our words down for about 5,000 years. Before then, we recorded information using pictures and diagrams on pottery and cave walls or woven into fabric.
If the mouth area of head was emphasized, that could mean, "mouth". Mouth combined with water meant, "drink," and mouth joined to bread meant, "eat."
Add the symbol for ox, and you have "eat an ox". Voila - the invention of writing! But some words have meanings that are hard to represent with symbols.
How would you draw, "ox in the mountains"? Remember, if you just draw what you mean, that's art, not writing. In order for this to be writing, the symbol has to stand for the word.
Right, "To be or not to be." That's how the Sumerians solved the problem too. Ox plus water plus mountain.
The "Epic of Gilgamesh" and the "Code of Hammurabi" were written in variants of cuneiform.
As this technology spread, these symbols found their way to Greece and into the most widely used alphabet in the world today. But Sumeria wasn't the only place on Earth where writing was invented. Ancient Egyptians developed their hieroglyphic and hieratic scripts at about the same time, 3500 B.C.
[music playing] We're in the British Museum and looking at one of the real treasures of early medieval British history. This is the Sutton Hoo Ship Burial, which comes from East Anglia.
Various attempts were made by people like Ethelbert to unite those kingdoms. Also at this time Germanic tribes and Danish tribes were Christianized in the 500's and 600's.
So with the Sutton Hoo Ship Burial we have some very rare artifacts from a period when there's not a lot of building, there's not a lot of paintings, a very unstable period in medieval history. You really get a sense of what that world was like from the things that we found in the burial. You find objects of warfare, you find swords, you find this man's helmet, shields.
And so the cloisonné is this kind of division of areas using metal wire, and then filling in those spaces in between with enamel. It's interesting that almost everything in the ship burial has disintegrated. Almost everything has rotted; even the bones of the man that would have been buried have dissolved.
Let's say Pete over here thinks that he's a pretty good investor. What he does is, he has an idea that says, "Look.
He also registers himself with the SEC or even better, he registers a management company that he runs with the SEC.
Let's call it Pete Inc., is a corporation he starts off that he also registers with the SEC.
When he registers with the SEC he tells them that, "Look. This company right over here,
Sometimes you'll see AUM, that just means assets under management.
That will go to Pete Inc. every year for figuring out the best place to invest this money. It's usually on the order of about 1%, sometimes a little bit less, sometimes a little bit more. 1% per year.
Since he registered with the SEC he can call himself a mutual fund and he can solicit funds from the public. It is a mutual fund. He has jumped through all of the hoops that the SEC sets up for him so he can market himself as some type of great fund manager.
"Hey, I want Pete to manage my money too." So Sal goes and he gives $100 and says, "Pete, give me a share."
We had $500 of assets under management. This whole assets under management a year later goes to, let's say it goes to $1000. Pete either is really good or really lucky or a little bit of both.
There's an NAV per share.
The NAV per share right over here is $200. I just took the total NAV and I just divided it by the shares. What's special about an open-ended mutual fund is that the close or the end of every day, either new shares can be removed from the fund or it could be created before the fund.
I wanted to buy into the fund, so I bought a share and that increased the NAV and it also increased the number of shares. He had to create a share for me to buy. He didn't sell me a share that already existed.
The NAV of each of these are $200. It gives these shares to each of these people and they had to contribute $200. Essentially it puts another $1000 into the pool that Pete can now manage.
These should be of equal size, and now the NAV per share is going to be 1800 divided by 10 or $180. Let's say that I get a little bit freaked out by this recent performance and I have some other commitments with my money. I said, "Pete, you need to buy a share back for me."
Write the equation of a line that has a slope of one-third, and contains the point negative 12, negative 14-thirds. So the equation of a line we can write as 'y' is equal to... ...'mx' plus 'b'. This is in slope-intercept form, where 'm' is our slope, and 'b' right over here is our y-intercept.
And now just isolate 'b' on the right hand side, we can add 4 to both sides.
I want to get rid of this negative 4 so lets add 4 to both sides. So plus 4, plus 4, we are left with, on the right hand side, we are left with just a 'b'. 'b' is equal to... On the left hand side we have 4.
Thank you very much. I moved to America 12 years ago with my wife Terry and our two kids. Actually, truthfully, we moved to Los Angeles -- (Laughter) thinking we were moving to America, but anyway, it's a short plane ride from Los Angeles to America.
Education under No Child Left Behind is based on not diversity but conformity. What schools are encouraged to do is to find out what kids can do across a very narrow spectrum of achievement.
One of the effects of No Child Left Behind has been to narrow the focus onto the so-called STEM disciplines. They're very important. I'm not here to argue against science and math.
I want to make one clarification on my video on super, or actually I should say supernovae, because that's the plural for supernova, is that I said this supernova occurred a thousand years ago. That's actually not precisely right. The supernova was first observed 1,000 years ago.
Multiply 6 times 1/4. Simplify your answer and write it as a mixed number. So let's just do the multiplication.
You'll often hear the words "depreciation" and "amortization" used together. And what I want to do in this video is understand a little bit better why they are similar and the slight difference between the two. So in our previous examples we've done depreciation so you can imagine, in period 0 we buy a truck for $60,000 and instead of just expensing it in period 0, instead of putting $60,000 expense right over here, we capitalize it.
Lets see if we can express 16 over 21 as an decimal Or we can call this sixteen twenty first. This is also sixteen divided by 21.
1 times 21 is 21, and now lets subtract This is a 10, this becomes a 3. 10 minus 1 is 9 3 minus 2 is 1 and we're going to have get this digit because we want to round to the nearest thousand.
Before we start going off into things outside of our solar system I wanna take a few steps back because I found this neat picture of the sun over here, and the reason why at least in my mind it's kinda mindblowing it's because at this scale the sun is obviously still a huge object at this scale, the Earth would be roughly, and this is an approximation, roughly that big, so for me at least, this is mindblowing because this idea that our whole planet, everything we could fit into one of these kind of plasma flares coming off of the sun, and you can only imagine, we can't realistically be there but if you were in some type of protective capsule what it would be like to be in this type of an enviroment so I just thought this was kind of a fascinating concept, but anyway, with that out of the way, let's just think about what it means to be at the boundary of the Solar System, in the last video we explored the Oort Belt which was about, it started a little under 1 light year away from the Sun but depending on what you view as a boundary it could be something way further in or as far out as something like the Oort Cloud
Giles: My name is Giles Shih. I'm president and CEO of BioResource International.
"There must be some kind of bacteria or microbe "that can digest the feathers." He knew that feathers aren't made out of protein.
What we're gonna talk about in this video is the idea of a fraction There's many ways to think about a fraction But first we'll think about the most fundamental
A parallelogram is a blank with two sets of parallel lines. So let's see what the options are. So one option is a quadrilateral.
Suzanne is on an expedition to save the universe. Sounds like a reasonable expedition to go on.
For her final challenge, she has to play a game called Find the Rhombuses. A wizard tells her that she has a square, a quadrilateral, and a parallelogram, and she must identify which of the shapes are also rhombuses. Which of these shapes should she pick to save the universe?
 Welcome back. In the last video, I showed you or hopefully, I did show you that if I apply a force of F to a stationary, an initially stationary object with mass m, and I apply that force for distance d, that that force times distance, the force times the distance that I'm pushing the object is equal to 1/2 mv squared, where m is the mass of the object, and v is the velocity of the object after pushing it for a distance of d.
And so, by definition, kinetic energy is the amount of work-- and I mean this is the definition right here. It's the amount of work you need to put into an object or apply to an object to get it from rest to its current velocity. So its velocity over here.
Let's say I have a different situation, and we're on this planet, we're not in deep space. And I have a mass of m and I were to apply a force. So let's say the force that I apply is equal to mass times the acceleration of gravity.
It moves up 100 meters. So we know that the work done by whatever was pulling on this elevator, it probably was the tension in this wire that was pulling up on the elevator, but we know that the work done is the force necessary to pull up on it. Well that's just going to be the force of gravity.
So we know that its potential energy is equal to mass times gravitational acceleration times height. So mass is 1.
Times 10 meters per second squared. Times 10 meters, which is the height. So it's approximately equal to 100 Newton meters, which is the same thing is 100 joules.
Now that we're comfortable with the "why" of why we do something to both sides of an equation, let's see if we can apply it to some equations to solve for an unknown variable. So let's say that you have x plus seven is equal to ten, and I want to solve for x.
What I want to discuss a little bit in this video
Is the idea of a random Variable And random variables are first a little bit confusing because we would want to think of them as traditional variables that you are first exposed to in algebra class and that's not quite what random variables are
Random variables are really ways to map outcomes of random processes to numbers So if you have a random process, like you're flipping a coin or you're rolling dice, or you're messuring the rain than may fall tomorrow, so random process you're really just mapping outcomes of that to numbers you're quantifying the outcomes so what's an example of a random variable
Well let's define one right over here so I'm gonna define random variable capital X and they tend to be denoted by capital letters so random variable capital X, I will define it as is going to be equal to 1 if my fair coin rolls heads and it's going to be equal to 0 if tails I could have define this any way I wanted to This is actually a fairly typical way of defining a random variable supposed to be a coin flip but I could have define this is a 100 and I could have define this is 703 and this would still be a legitimate random variable
We can define another random variable capital Y as equal to
let say, the sum of, roll, let say, seven dices we talk about the sum of seven let me write this, the sum of upward faces, after rolling seven dices Once again, we are quantifying an outcome for a random process where the random process is rolling these 7 dice and seeing what sides show up on top and then we are taking those and we're taking the sum and we are defining a random variable in that way
And if we now cared, if someone else cares about the probability, that this sum of the upward face after rolling seven dice if they say, hey, what's the probability that that's even instead of having to write all that over, they can say, well, what's the probability that Y is even? Now, the one thing that I do want to emphasize is how these are different than traditional variables, traditional variables that you see in your algebra class like, x plus 5 is equal to 6, usually denoted by lowercase variables. y is equal to x plus 7.
I have a tough job to do. You know, when I looked at the profile of the audience here, with their connotations and design, in all its forms, and with so much and so many people working on collaborative and networks, and so on, that I wanted to tell you, I wanted to build an argument for primary education in a very specific context.
The first piece of the puzzle is remoteness and the quality of education. Now, by remoteness, I mean two or three different kinds of things. Of course, remoteness in its normal sense, which means that as you go further and further away from an urban center, you get to remoter areas.
The literature -- one part of it, the scientific literature -- consistently blames ET as being over-hyped and under-performing. The teachers always say, well, it's fine, but it's too expensive for what it does. Because it's being piloted in a school where the students are already getting,
They cut a hole inside that wall -- which is how it has got the name hole-in-the-wall -- and put a pretty powerful PC into that hole, sort of embedded into the wall so that its monitor was sticking out at the other end, a touchpad similarly embedded into the wall, put it on high-speed Internet, put the Internet Explorer there, put it on Altavista.com -- in those days -- and just left it there. And this is what we saw. So that was my office in IlT.
500 years ago, trans-oceanic travel became a reality. Since the end of the last Ice Age, farming societies have been absorbing their neighbors, making populations more similar within continents. That when people began to cross oceans, in large numbers, the genetic and cultural differences between people from different continents also began to fade, though not disappear.
In the last video, we started thinking a little bit about the aggregate demand curve and why it might be downward sloping and we actually reviewed some of the possible justifications for a downwards sloping aggregate demand curve, the wealth affect. Remember, all other things equal. We're not talking about changing the amount of money in people's pockets or changing their outlook or changing their jobs or changing the level of investment, we're just saying if prices were to just go down, all of a sudden people would have ...
Real GDP would go up and that was the Wealth Affect and likewise if prices went up, the opposite would happen. People would have less money or they would have the same amount of money in their pockets, but they could buy less with it and so they would demand less and real GDP would go ... real GDP, real GDP would go down. The other factor or justification I should really say, because these are really just theories so you should view them with huge grains of salt, is that if prices ...
And you might remember GDP and we use Y as the variable for GDP.
It's equal to ... It's equal to consumption plus investment plus government spending plus net exports and this is a pretty good way to think about what are all the things that might shift the aggregate demand curve. First of all you could think about consumption, if there was some factor that would cause consumption to increase.
So if the government says, "Hey, maybe ... Maybe we're going to incur", assuming they're already spending as much money as they have or maybe more than they have,
"We're going to incur even more ... even more "debt to ... to spend more money." So if government spending were to go up,
They can't produce it themselves and that net exports were to go up, if net exports were to go up, that means more people in other countries are buying our goods and services, then that, too, would cause aggregate demand to go up or on the other hand, if all of a sudden people in our country started saying, "Hey, we don't want to buy the stuff that we"
"produce. We want to buy what the people on the other" "side of the ocean are producing."
So to really think about how aggregate demand shifts, you just have to really think about the components of GDP and how different macro ... macro things might impact those components of GDP and those will tell you whether at a ... at a given level of prices of goods and services in the economy whether it'll shift demand to the right or to the left.

To see the difference between cash accounting and accrual accounting I'm going to go through this little example and first I'm going to account for things using a cash basis of accounting and then we'll do it with an accrual basis accounting and just so you have some context, the cash basis is: anytime you get cash from a customer you would count that as revenue and anytime you have to spend cash you would count that as an expense you'll see that this is what most small businesses do while most slightly more sophisticated businesses would use accrual based accounting, because that matches up, kind of, your actual expenses and your revenue a little bit better in each period so let's just go through this example using the cash basis first. And we're gonna assume that we start off with no money.
Where I left off in the last video, we talked about how the hemoglobin in red blood cells is what sops up all of the oxygen so that it increases the diffusion gradient-- or it increases the incentive, we could say, for the oxygen to go across the membrane. We know that the oxygen molecules don't know that there's less oxygen here, but if you watch the video on diffusion you know how that process happens. If there's less concentration here than there, the oxygen will diffuse across the membrane and there's less inside the plasma because the hemoglobin is sucking it all up like a sponge.
Now, one interesting question is, why does the hemoglobin even have to reside within the red blood cells? Why aren't hemoglobin proteins just freely floating in the blood plasma?
That seems more efficient. You don't have to have things crossing through, in and out of, these red blood cell membranes. You wouldn't have to make red blood cells.
I don't want to say like syrup, but it would become thicker than blood is right now-- and by packaging the hemoglobin inside these containers, inside the red blood cells, what it allows the blood to do is flow a lot better. Imagine if you wanted to put syrup in water. If you just put syrup straight into water, what's going to happen?
Instead of having the hemoglobin sit in the plasma and make it gooey, it sits inside these beads that we call red blood cells that allows the flow to still be non-viscous. So I've been all zoomed in here on the alveolus and these capillaries, these pulmonary capillaries-- let's zoom out a little bit-- or zoom out a lot-- just to understand, how is the blood flowing?
Remember, we get to them from our bronchioles, which are branching off of the bronchi, which branch off of the trachea, which connects to our larynx, which connects to our pharynx, which connects to our mouth and nose. But anyway, we have our little alveoli right there and then we have the capillaries. So when we go away from the heart-- and we're going to delve a little bit into the heart in this video as well-- so when blood travels away from the heart, it's de-oxygenated.
But what we have is, the heart pumps de-oxygenated blood from the right ventricle. You're saying, hey, why is it the right ventricle? That looks like the left side of the drawing, but it's this dude's right-hand side, right?
So this is his right ventricle. Actually, let me just start off with the whole cycle. So we have de-oxygenated blood coming from the rest of the body, right?
From the right atrium, it gets pumped into the right ventricle.
It actually passively flows into the right ventricle. The ventricles do all the pumping, then the ventricle contracts and pumps this blood right here-- and you don't see it, but it's going behind this part right here. It goes from here through this pipe.
Atrium, you can imagine-- it's kind of a room with a skylight or that's open to the outside and in both of these cases, things are entering from above-- not sunlight, but blood is entering from above.
On the right atrium, the blood is entering from above.
And in the left atrium, the blood is entering-- and remember, the left atrium is on the right-hand side from our point of view-- on the left atrium, the blood is entering from above from the lungs, from the pulmonary veins.
Veins go to the heart. Then it goes into-- and I'll go into more detail-- into the left ventricle and then the left ventricle pumps that oxygenated blood to the rest of the body via the non-pulmonary arteries.
This is veins from our abdomen and from our legs and the rest of our body. So it it first enters the right atrium.
Remember, we call the right atrium because this is someone's heart facing us, even though this is on the left-hand side. It enters through here.
And it passively, once the right ventricle pumps and then releases, it has a vacuum and it pulls more blood from the right atrium.
It pumps again and then it pushes it through here. Now this blood right here-- remember, this one still is de-oxygenated blood. De-oxygenated blood goes to the lungs to become oxygenated.
Now in the left ventricle, after it's done pumping, it expands and that oxygenated blood flows into the left ventricle.
Then the left ventricle-- the ventricles are what do all the pumping-- it squeezes and then it pumps the blood into the aorta. This is an artery. Why is it an artery?
Because we're going away from the heart. Is it a pulmonary artery? No, we're not dealing with the lungs anymore.
We pump into the aorta. Now this is to go to the rest of the body. This is an artery, a non-pulmonary artery-- and it is oxygenated.
Celiac, if I remember correctly, kind of refers to an abdomen. So this blood that-- your hepatic artery.
Hepatic deals with the liver.
Your hepatic artery branches off of this to get blood flow to the liver. It also gives blood flow to your stomach so it's very important in digestion and all that.
And then let's say this is the hepatic trunk. Your liver is sitting like that.
Hepatic trunk-- it delivers oxygen to the liver. The liver is doing respiration. It takes up the oxygen and then it gives up carbon dioxide.
You have these these arteries up here that they first branch off the arteries up here from the aorta into the head and the neck and the arm arteries and then later they go down and they flow blood to the rest of the body. So anyway, this is a pretty interesting idea. In the next video, what I want to do is talk about, how does the hemoglobin know when to dump the oxygen?
So far we've talked about how the Fed can control the money supply by performing these open market transactions where they're buying and selling Treasury securities. But you're probably asking, when I read the newspaper headlines about all of this, I don't hear about the open market transactions so much and I don't hear about them buying treasuries so much. I always hear them setting the Federal funds rate, or the discount rate, or the target rate.
Today I'm going to talk about unexpected discoveries. Now I work in the solar technology industry. And my small startup is looking to force ourselves into the environment by paying attention to ...
... paying attention to crowd-sourcing. It's just a quick video of what we do. Huh.
(Laughter)
(Music)
This is not ...
(Laughter) Okay.
(Laughter) Solar technology is ... Oh, that's all my time?
In the last series of examples we go into month 2 with $100 of cash and the way we set up the example we spend $200 in month 2 and what we've been doing so far is saying "Oh! That gets us to a cash balance of negative $100 at the end of month 2"
The person you are catering for, that you're buying those $200 of supply for, they're not going to pay you until next month, so you tell the people that you need to buy stuff from "Look,I only have $100 dollars, I have this customer, I'm doing thec atering for him this month. Can I pay $100 for it to you this month, and then maybe pay another $100 to you next month?"
The fact that you essentially told your vendors, "even though you gave me $200 worth of stuff, I'm only going to pay you $100 now and I'm going to give you $100 later" That means that you've increased your Accounts Payable by $100.
Say we have a right triangle. Let me draw my right triangle just like that. This is a right triangle.
And if you're not sure about that, you're probably thinking, hey Sal, how do I know that a is shorter than this side over here? How do I know it's not 15 or 16? And the way to tell is that the longest side in a right triangle, and this only applies to a right triangle, is the side opposite the 90 degree angle.
On the left-hand side, we're going to be left with just the a squared. These two guys cancel out, the whole point of subtracting 81. So we're left with a squared is equal to 196 minus 81.
One day, Los Angeles Times columnist
Steve Lopez was walking along the streets of downtown Los Angeles when he heard beautiful music. And the source was a man, an African-American man, charming, rugged, homeless, playing a violin that only had two strings.
And I'm telling a story that many of you know, because Steve's columns became the basis for a book, which was turned into a movie, with Robert Downey Jr. acting as Steve Lopez, and Jamie Foxx as Nathaniel Anthony Ayers, the Juilliard-trained double bassist whose promising career was cut short by a tragic affliction with paranoid schizophrenia.
Nathaniel dropped out of Juilliard, he suffered a complete breakdown, and 30 years later he was living homeless on the streets of Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles. I encourage all of you to read Steve's book or to watch the movie to understand not only the beautiful bond that formed between these two men, but how music helped shape that bond, and ultimately was instrumental -- if you'll pardon the pun -- in helping Nathaniel get off the streets.
I met Mr. Ayers in 2008, two years ago, at Walt Disney Concert Hall.
He had just heard a performance of Beethoven's First and Fourth symphonies, and came backstage and introduced himself.
He was speaking in a very jovial and gregarious way about Yo-Yo Ma and Hillary Clinton and how the Dodgers were never going to make the World Series, all because of the treacherous first violin passage work in the last movement of Beethoven's Fourth Symphony. And we got talking about music, and I got an email from Steve a few days later saying that Nathaniel was interested in a violin lesson with me.
Now, I should mention that Nathaniel refuses treatment because when he was treated it was with shock therapy and Thorazine and handcuffs, and that scar has stayed with him for his entire life. But as a result now, he is prone to these schizophrenic episodes, the worst of which can manifest themselves as him exploding and then disappearing for days, wandering the streets of Skid Row, exposed to its horrors, with the torment of his own mind unleashed upon him.
And Nathaniel was in such a state of agitation when we started our first lesson at Walt Disney Concert Hall -- he had a kind of manic glint in his eyes, he was lost.
And he was talking about invisible demons and smoke, and how someone was poisoning him in his sleep. And I was afraid, not for myself, but I was afraid that I was going to lose him, that he was going to sink into one of his states, and that I would ruin his relationship with the violin if I started talking about scales and arpeggios and other exciting forms of didactic violin pedagogy. (Laughter)
And I played the first movement of the Beethoven Violin Concerto. And as I played,
I understood that there was a profound change occurring in Nathaniel's eyes. It was as if he was in the grip of some invisible pharmaceutical, a chemical reaction, for which my playing the music was its catalyst.
And Nathaniel's manic rage was transformed into understanding, a quiet curiosity and grace. And in a miracle, he lifted his own violin and he started playing, by ear, certain snippets of violin concertos which he then asked me to complete -- Mendelssohn,
Tchaikovsky, Sibelius.
And we started talking about music, from Bach to Beethoven and Brahms,
Bruckner, all the B's, from Bartók, all the way up to Esa-Pekka Salonen.
And I understood that he not only had an encyclopedic knowledge of music, but he related to this music at a personal level.
He spoke about it with the kind of passion and understanding that I share with my colleagues in the Los Angeles Philharmonic. And through playing music and talking about music, this man had transformed from the paranoid, disturbed man that had just come from walking the streets of downtown Los Angeles to the charming, erudite, brilliant, Juilliard-trained musician. Music is medicine.
And for Nathaniel, music is sanity. Because music allows him to take his thoughts and delusions and shape them through his imagination and his creativity, into reality. And that is an escape from his tormented state.
And for Nathaniel, music brought him back into a fold of friends. The redemptive power of music brought him back into a family of musicians that understood him, that recognized his talents and respected him.
And I will always make music with Nathaniel, whether we're at Walt Disney Concert Hall or on Skid Row, because he reminds me why I became a musician.
Thank you. (Applause)
Bruno Giussani: Thank you. Thanks.
Robert Gupta. (Applause)
Robert Gupta: I'm going to play something that I shamelessly stole from cellists. So, please forgive me.
(Applause)
This is my first trip, my first foreign trip as a first lady. Can you believe that? (Applause)
He talked about "the world as it is" and "the world as it should be." And I talked about this throughout the entire campaign. What he said, that all too often, is that we accept the distance between those two ideas.
And its name, Resolute, is a reminder of the strength of character that's required not only to lead a country, but to live a life of purpose, as well. And I hope in pursuing your dreams, you all remain resolute, that you go forward without limits, and that you use your talents -- because there are many; we've seen them; it's there -- that you use them to create the world as it should be. Because we are counting on you.
I have two identical rectangles here, and I want to measure how much each of them, how much space each of them takes up on the plane of my screen, the screen you are looking at right now. And I want to do it using two different units. It is clear since they are two identical rectangles that they take up the exact same amount of space.
And, it is also one foot in height. One foot in height. So, this right over here is equal to one square foot.
Twelve square feet. Now, I am going to try to measure that same area in a different unit. And I am going to make up this unit.
Most people will not recognize what a furgle is. So, its height is one "furgle" and its width is one "furgle." And so we can say that this is one square "furgle."
The area of this figure in "furgles" -- square "furgles," I should say -- the area is three square "furgles." Three square "furgles". So it's the same exact area.
Welcome back. I'm now going to take a slight tangent and cover a topic that, I think, this is probably the single most important video that really anyone can watch. I go to all of these parties where I go see family.
I make $45,000 less than I actually did. So if I'm getting taxed at, let's say 30%, what is the actual cash savings? Well I'll save 30% of this.
Property taxes.
So 1% times $1 million.
That equals what?
1% of $1 million is another $10,000 a year in property taxes.
And notice, I'm not talking about what percent of my mortgage goes to pay principal.
I'm just talking about money that's being burned by owning this house.
So what is the net effect?
I have a $13,500 tax savings.
I have to pay $10,000
--actually I have to pay a little bit more than that, but we're getting a little bit of income tax savings on the deduction on the property taxes.
And then I actually have to pay the $45,000 of interest that just goes out the door.
So I'm paying $41,500.
Notice, none of this $41,500 is building equity.
None of it is getting saved.
This is money that is just being burned.
So this is a completely comparable value to this $26,000.
So in this example -- this example is not that far off from real values.
Out here in the Bay area, I can rent a $1 million house for about $3,000.
But in this situation I am burning, every year $41,500, where I could just rent the same house for $26,000 out of my pocket, when I adjust for everything.
And then people a couple of years ago said, oh, but houses appreciate.
And that's what would make it up.
But now you know, very recently -- we know that that's not the case.
And in the next video, I'll delve into this, and a little bit more.
I'll see you soon.
In the last two videos, we explored situations where the aggregate demand curve shifted to the right and that caused inflation. That's actually called demand-pull inflation. What I want to do in this video is study a situation where the short-run aggregate supply curve shifts to the left and that causes inflation.
Prices won't have to go up more. There's a lot of slack in the economy. While as GDP gets higher and higher, maybe even going beyond its potential, starts to get overheated and in order for people to get very high levels of utilization, essentially get more people to enter the labor market, work longer hours, work overtime, the prices are going to essentially have to go up.
How do you maintain a steady body temperature when you're exposed to ice packs or hot water bottles? Healthy body temperature is 37° C or 98,6°F. I need to keep a steady temperature near 98,6°F or else crucial molecules in my body will change shape and stop working, and I'll die.
There are other forms of homeostasis to regulate things besides temperature. e.g. When your blood pressure drops suddenly which can happen if you stand up suddenly your blood vessels constrict, which brings your blood pressure up to normal. Also, if your blood sugar rises, which can happen after eating, your pancreas releases insulin to lower your blood sugar back to normal.
Before we get into the meat of algebra, I want to give you a quote from one of the greatest minds in human history, Galileo Galilei, because I think this quote encapsulates the true point of algebra and really mathematics in general.
let's say -- we know that y is equal to p times x -- what if you want to have them both be equal. What is y divided by x gonna be equal to ? Well y was equal to p times x so y divided by x is gonna be the same as p times x divided by x
-- well if you multiply by something and divide by that something you're gonna get the original number.
If you multiply by 5 and divide by 5, you're just gonna get p, or whatever this number is.
So those would cancel out. But we were able to manipulate the abstraction here, and get y over x is equal to p -- we make that x green -- y over x is equal to p and now this has implications, this has implications for every one of these ideas.
In the last video, I talked about the two campaigns that eventually lead to Napoleon's downfall. One of those was the Peninsular Campaign. Where Napoleon and the French Empire had to waste a significant amount of resources fighting and trying to hold Spain.
In the Treaty of Tilsit he thought he was being nice to them. Just don't do any trade with Great Britain, we're going to be good buddies. But then what really got Napoleon is in 1812, he hears that Russia is thinking about taking the French Empire's part of Poland, or the Duchy of Warsaw.
But that was too big for my screen. So this is a smaller version. But it's a fascinating chart.
What I wanna do in this video is go over what I think is one of the more intuitive ways to sort a list. It's how I would probably sort it if I had to do it manually. But I wanna make it clear, it is not the most efficient way to sort a list.
I can implement it in Python,
I can implement it in C,
I can implement it in Java. Those are all specific programs, but they'd all be implementing the same way of doing the sort.
And that's what I'm just describing— the Insertion Sort Algorithm. So let's just start with a simple example: Let's say that I have a list—
So, you could start with the 7, the 0th element over here, but when you look at— when you start with the 0th element, you'll like "Hey wait, there is nothing before to compare it to," so it really doesn't make sense to start with 0th element. So, really, if you were to implement this algorithm, you'd start with the [1st] element— Oh, sorry!
So you start with this 3 here and you start comparing it to all of the elements before it and as soon as you find an element that 3 is less than you stick it in that part of the list. So what you do is you say: 'OK, is 3 less than 7?'
Given all the data that we've explored in the last video and that we have over here, the very high debt to GDP burden that Greece has and the very weak economy, it's already in a deep recession. It's especially apparent when you look at its unemployment rate. This is the period October 2010 to March 2012, unemployment rate was already high in 2010 and it's just been going through the roof, it's already in the low 20% which is a huge number and even that is understating how bad things are on the ground in Greece because the unemployment is disproportionately affecting the young so if you looked at the unemployment rate for people in their 20's it would be much much much higher than even this already unbelievably high unemployment rate.
The Eurozone is the subset of European union countries that use the Euro as their currency.
And we've already talked about this, it would not be a painless process.
They would leave the Eurozone, the new currency would be the new Greek drachma and with this it would be probably hugely devalued relative to the Euro so you would have savings wiped out, maybe not fully wiped out, but savings devalued for Greek savers, and they know that already, that's why, because this outcome is looking more and more likely, there is essentially a run on banks in Greece right now.
People are going, withdrawing their Euros, so they can stuff them in their mattresses, so they won't be converted in devalued drachmas.
But this is having the effect of really weak [..?..] potentially breaking down the banking system.
So you could have bank failures.
And the whole strategy of leaving the Eurozone,
leaving the Euro and going to the drachma, would be to inflate away your liabilities, would be literally to inflate away your debt obligations and your entitlement obligations, but that inflation, and this has definitively happened in the past with countries in this situation, could very easily turn to hyper inflation.
And so whether you look at austerity in this reality, where you get bailed out, or you look at this reality over here, in either situation, in the medium term, the economy can really fall apart, it's really not clear how, outside of maybe extra generous bailout, how that can be avoided.
And so in that situation, the economy falls apart.
And when economy falls apart, in a big way, and you have major unemployment, it is a scary thing, it can lead to social unrest.
And I'm not talking about 8%, 9% or 10% of uneployment rate like we have in US, we are talking about 20%, 30%, 40% unemployment rate, even higher in the folks that are likely to be unrestful socially, which is the young people, so this could lead to social unrest, and even radicalization, when people start worrying about whether they get food on the table and they don't have a job, they might start supporting people who have more radical views.
So just that by itself, is very, very scary proposition.
The history of Europe tells us that even if relatively small countries in Europe fall apart in this way, it could have repercussions in the rest of Europe.
This is how the World War I and World War II got started.
Just that reason alone is reason enough for people to think very seriously about bailing Greece out.
And it doesn't come without moral consequences, the counter-argument is - if we bailed them out doesn't this reward mismanagement and overspending?
And even a little bit of shady accounting on their national economic statistics.
So, there's a very good reason, if you are a German tax payer, then you are very suspicious of these bailouts.
Why we are keep running the cheques to the Greeks if they are not willing to take some pain?
Now the Greek side of it, they say "Look, we've already taken amount of pain, we are already kind of on the brink, possibly across the brink, if you force even more pain on us, then we are going to be in really, our society is at the risk of falling apart.
So, we are in a desperate situation.
This is not a time to kind of force a moral point on us."
So that by itself is a reason why people are worried but then there is even a bigger reason that Greece might not be the only, it's only the first, maybe the worst, of the situations but if Greece falls apart, and especially if the Eurozone - or, I should say, the European Union or Europe - is not able to bail out Greece that's an implicit signal to the rest of world that Europe is not able to essentially bail out its countries.
So, you see on this chart right over here,
Greece is not alone, it is definitely the worst, but right behind it, you have Portugal.
And its debt, you have long-term debt with interest rates
looks like around the 12 or 13% range.
Portugal has a 93% debt to GDP ratio and already has very high unemployment rate.
If Greece is allowed to leave Eurozone and does not get bailed out, investors are going to start wondering
"Well, hey, maybe Portugal is not going to get bailed out".
This going to make people expect more interest from Portugal in order to lend them money, and they need money in order to continue operating in the way they are operating, but every increase in a percentage point, right over here, is going to really eat into Portuguese GDP and kind of force them down its debt spiral.
Their debt as percentage of their GDP is almost 100% if they have to pay an extra one percent on that, that 1% is going to eat into their GDP and it is going to force Portugal, the economy to slow down even more and make it even more and more onerous and they would just kind of go in the same direction as Greece.
And once again, Portugal is not alone, Italy has a very high debt to GDP,
Ireland - very high debt to GDP ratio,
Spain has a very high unemployment rate.
So, the fear here - and I guess there are two major fears - one is that Greece by itself can become a point of instability in Europe, but the second fear, if this thing isn't solved, that this could cause a kind of contagion or a chain reaction through Europe, that people start getting freaked out, they start wanting to not lend to these countries, that becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, they might also have to leave the Eurozone.
Imagine two people who share an important secret have to split up. This requires them to communicate private information from a distance. However, an eavesdropper named Eve also wants this information, and has the ability to intercept their messages.
When Bob receives the box, he opens it using the code they shared in advance. This is called 'decryption.' Cryptography begins when we abandon physical locks and use 'ciphers' instead.
Think of [ciphers] as virtual locks. Ciphers allow Alice and Bob to scramble and descramble their messages so that they would appear meaningless if Eve intercepted them.
Cryptography has been around for thousands of years. It has decided wars, and is at the heart of the worldwide communication network today.
The fascinating story of cryptography requires us to understand two very old ideas related to number theory and probability theory.
And we begin with a very simple question, or -- not a question -- a challenge. We need to build a machine which takes an input -- (And that input is some integer, 'x.')
And all that machine needs to do is output 'true' or 'false.' And that is the first step. Now we will use the

We finished off the last video in the Hadean Eon. It was named for Hades or the ancient greek Underworld
Hades is also the name of the guy who ran the ancient greek underworld
Zeus's older brother and it was an appropriate name, although the idea, the ancient greek notion of the underworld isn't exactly the modern notion of hell, but it was a hellish environment, you had all this lava flowing around and things impacting the earth from space. As far as we can tell right now it was completely inhospitable to life. And to make matters worse, even though the earth started to cool down a little bit, maybe the crust became a little bit more solid, maybe the collisions started to happen less and less as we started to go a few hundred million years fast forward after
Theia ran into the early earth and formed the moon There is something like the "Late heavy bombardment" and right now the consensus is that life - whatever we are descended from - would have had to come about after the late heavier bombardment, because this was a time when so many things from outer space were hitting earth, it was so violent, that it might have killed off any kind of primitive, self replicating organisms or molecules that might have existed before it. And I won't go into the physics of the late heavy bombardment.
This shows our current understanding of where things branched off from, at this point of the tree is some common ancestor to prokaryotes and eukaryotes prokaryotes right over here the bacteria and archeae and here is the eucaryotes and this first living thing we think might have been some self replicating molecules, maybe a little bit more organized membrane, DNA and RNA became the method of passing information from one generation to the next It is still an open question what that first life is or how you even define that first life Based on the makeup of DNA molecules of the current organisms, this is how the think the tree of life came about
All of the life for the next billion years all occured in the oceans. There was no ozone layer. The land was being irradiated, a completely inhospitable environment for life.
Still a few billions years though before things start flopping around on the land.
Right now, somewhere out there, an educator is delivering a mind-altering lesson to their class. I want to engage your brains in this.
Chris Anderson: I tried to get my head around how vast our Earth is.
Logan Smalley: That lesson only reaches the students in that room. What would happen if we captured it?
LS: What if pro animators and visualization artists could bring that lesson to life?
CA: It's a common object that literally fits one million Earths. It's got a bunch of notches and a bunch of teeth.
This was Fizeau's solution --
LS: When that lesson lands, curiosity is ignited. CA:
CA: In the great scheme of things, it's a pinprick.
AS: A door closes on the light beam that's coming back to his eye. Then that group of students is one thought closer to being what every teacher hopes their students will become: a lifelong learner.
AS: Based on the distance between the two stations --
CA: The quest for knowledge and understanding never gets dull.
AS: He calculates the speed of light to within two percent of its actual value.
CA: The more you know, the more amazing the world seems.
That's the central mission of TED-Ed: to capture and to amplify the voice of the world's greatest teachers. He does this in 1849.
It's the crazy possibilities, the unanswered questions, that pull us forward.
TED-Ed is really an invitation to teachers all around the world to submit their best lessons.
Jordan Reeves: We review each submission and work with the educators to refine the lesson and make sure that they're less than ten minutes long. From there, we mail out these portable recording booths.
It's also an invitation to animators. We are looking for talented animators to get involved, submit their reels and help us animate these incredible lessons.
LS: Right now, there's a gifted educator somewhere out there delivering a life-changing lesson.
The TED-Ed team hopes that anyone who is passionate about education will help us find that teacher, capture that moment and amplify it the way that it deserves to be amplified.
 We're asked to factor this expression by grouping. Now, they mention grouping, we're going to see what grouping is, but we're going to see very quickly that we have to do this thing called grouping because you can't just factor this expression.
Well, I could write it as a product of 5r times-- what's 5rs divided by 5r?
Well, you still have an s left over, you just have an s there. Plus-- what's 25r divided by 5r? Well, 25 divided by 5 is 5, and r divided by r is just 1.
Well, they definitely have a common factor, you have a negative 3 or positive 3 common to both of these. Let's just go with the negative 3. And our goal is really to factor it into a negative 3 times, hopefully, something very similar to s plus 5.
So these two terms you can rewrite as negative 3 times-- what's negative 3s divided by negative 3? Well, you're just going to have an s left over.
And then what's negative 15 divided by negative 3? Well, that's just positive 5. And just like that, we've grouped them and we're able to factor each of those groups, and then something interesting might pop out at you.
 We're told that the glass portion of the window shown below-- that's the window-- has a height to width the ratio of 3:2. So the height of the glass portion can be represented as 3x and the width of the glass portion can be represented as 2x.
 We're told to solve and graph the solution for the system of equations right here. And the first thing that jumps out at me, is that we might be able to eliminate one of the variables.
So let's multiply this equation, this second equation, by negative 2. So I'm going to multiply both sides of this equation by negative 2.
And the whole motivation is so that this 2x becomes a negative 4x. And, of course, I can't just multiply only the 2x. Anything I do to the left-hand side of the equation I have to do to every term, and I have to do to both sides of the equation.
So the second equation becomes negative 4x-- that's negative 2 times 2x-- plus-- we have negative 2 times negative y-- which is plus 2y is equal to 2.5 times negative 2, is equal to negative 5. I just rewrote the second equation, multiplying both sides by negative 2. Now, this top equation-- I'll write it on the bottom now-- we have 4x minus 2y is equal to positive 5.
We can say, hey, look, the negative 4x and the positive 4x should cancel out, or they will cancel out. So let's add these two equations. Let's add the left side to the left side, the right side to the right side, and we can do that because these two things are equal.
If we take our negative 4x plus our 4x, well, those cancel out. So you're left with nothing. Maybe I could write a 0 there.
So then I'm left with negative 2y is equal to negative 4x plus 5. Now we can divide both sides by negative 2. And we are left with y is equal to positive 2x, right, that's positive 2x, minus 2.5.
So negative 2.5 right there, and then it has a slope of 2. So if we move up 1, if we move up in the x-direction, if we move to the right 1 in the positive x-direction, we will move up 2. So 1, 2.
He's a dispatch runner on the Western Front; he actually gets fairly decorated. And, by most accounts, this is where he finds meaning. He finds meaning in being part of the military; he finds meaning in, frankly, the war itself.
From their point of view, they somewhat delusionally believed that Germany would have won World War I, if they weren't stabbed in the back by these "November Criminals," by the folks who had taken over after the Kaiser. So you have this whole "stabbed in the back" theory. . . . "stab in the back" . . . by those who had taken over and signed the armistice. And this wasn't just believed by folks like Hitler.
It's called the Weimar Republic because the new German constitution is drafted in the town of . . . is drafted in the town of Weimar. And it sets it up as a parliamentary democracy - that's why we now call it - that's why it's called a republic. But it's a little bit bizarre of a parliamentary democracy.
But he actually gets quite impressed by the German Workers Party, which is really ultra-nationalist. And when we talk about ultra-nationalist, it's all about German race superiority, it's in line with this whole idea that they would have won the war if they weren't stabbed in the back, and it's also anti-communist . . . "anti-communist . . . " it's anti-capitalist, and it's anti- ethnic minorities and in particular, anti-Jewish. And all of these ideas, Hitler found very impressive.
So yes, they were anti-communist, they were anti-distribution of wealth - you know, communists believe in no classes, as little private property as possible, the German Workers Party didn't believe in that. They were anti that. But they were also anti unfettered capitalism, especially capitalism that might get in the way of the nation's interests.
They add to German Workers Party, they add the "Nationalist Socialist.". . .
"Nationalist Socialist German Workers Party."
DAP, German Workers Party, or the "NSDAP."
And if you pronounce "Nationalist" in German, it sounds something like - and I'm going to butcher it right now -
"Nazionalist"- and so if you were going to shorten it, they called themselves the "Nazis." "They called themselves the Nazis . . . " and Hitler actually designed the logo for the Nazis, which included this symbol right over here, the swastika. And the swastika is worth talking about, because it is really this bizarre corruption of a very ancient symbol.
It was a delusion, because frankly, there was an ancient Aryan race, but the best - the most indicative descendants of them are frankly the Persians, or the Indians. And actually, the swastika symbol here, you might actually even see it at a Hindu temple. It does not mean all of what we associated with Nazism now.
Then in 1922 - or, this - the hyperinflation is happening this entire time, and you can see it accelerates through 1922 and then 1923, but then in 1922 you have Mussolini comes to power in Italy, and he comes to power through his March on - "March on Rome." And Mussolini is a Fascist. That's where the word comes from.
So the Ruhr region is occupied - "occupied by France."
And you might remember from the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, the Sahr region was already being occupied, and all that coal was being shipped out to France.
The Ruhr region was another significant region of coal and steel production, and now the French are fully occupying this, they're forcing a lot of the civilians out of the region, they're forcing a lot of the workers to work in the mines and the factories, and then they're shipping all of that supply out to France. So, this adds further -it further debilitates the economy, but it's a huge humiliation. The Treaty of Versailles, in the minds of Germans, especially the minds of nationalists, was bad enough, but now you have this huge humiliation by the French.
Find the sum. Express the answer as a simplified rational expression, and state the domains. We have these two rational expressions, or two fractions, if you will.
Let's say that I have a huge frozen over lake, or maybe it is a big pond. So I have a huge surface of ice over here. This is my best attempt at drawing a flat surface of ice.
Your body is made up of 50 trillion cells, cells come in many different varieties, with different functions, but inside, almost of every cell is a nucleus, containing 99.9% of your genes, and mitochondria, containing a few more genes. All told, you've nearly 20,000 genes, your genes are small parts of a long molecule, called DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid. If you lined up all the DNA containing all of your genes, it would measure 6 feet long, but it's coiled, so tightly that it fits in just one cell nucleus.
DNA is a double stranded molecule composed of sugar, phosphate, and four different bases, adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine. These bases spell out the language known as the genetic code. The number and order of these four bases determine for example, whether you're a chimp, a cow, a banana, or a human.
Genes tell a cell how to function and what traits to express more specifically, gene regulators turn other genes on and off in different cells, to control cell function.
The long molecules of DNA, containing your genes, are organized into pieces called chromosomes.
different species have different numbers of chromosomes.
Humans usually have 46 chromosomes, two sets of 23, or simply 23 pairs of chromosomes. Chimpanzees have two sets of 24, or 24 pairs of chromosomes. Rhesus monkeys have 21 pairs of chromosomes.
Well, for one thing, SNiPs.
The function f(x) is graphed, what is its domain? So the way it's graphed right over here we can assume that this is the entire function definition for f(x) So for example if we say well what does f(x) equal when x is equal to -9? Well we go up here we dont see its graphed here it's not defined for x = -9 or x = -8 1/2 or x = -8 it's not defined for any of these values it only starts getting defined at x = -6 at x = -6 f(x) is equal to 5 and it keeps getting defined f(x) is defined for x all the way from x = -6 all the way to x = 7 when x = 7 half of x is equal to 5 you can take any x value between -6 including -6 and positive 7 including positive 7 and you just have to see you just have move up above that number wherever you are to find out what the value of the function is at that point.
So the domain of this function definition
Well f(x) is defined for any x that is greater than or equal to -6 or we can say -6 is less than or equal to x which is less than or equal to 7. If x satisfies this condition right over here the function is defined. So that's its domain, let's check our answer and do a few more of these.
If you start with the plain piece of wood, how do you go about making this in different shapes. It depends on what kind of tools you wanna use. Any time you take a raw product, and you use tools and machinery to turn it into something useful, what you're doing is manufacturing.
There is various ways that you can do that and various levels of automation. Automation is using computers and technology to help us instead of just using our own hands. Carpenters used to do everything by hand.
We have a hole, ladies and gentlemen. We can drill a hole by hand, but we can also use technology to help us do it faster and with less work. This is called the power drill.
we can drill right through. This is a piece of equipment called a CNC mill, which is a computer controlled piece of equipment that we can program to cut whatever shape we want. In this case we're going to be using this for drilling a hole, just like we used the power drill and just like we used the hand drill.
So, now we figured out how to drill the hole so that we have a nice centre for a flower, but what happens when we wanna make the petals? Now, instead of drilling, we're gonna have to use the technique called cutting. One of the earliest methods was just with the saw.
Just like our hand saw had a blade middle metal with teeth on it to cut your material, this is a machine called a band saw that has the same blade right down here, also made on the metal with teeth to cut your material but instead of pulling the blade by hand, you have a motor up here which turns the blade for us. So using this machine we can cut right to our material.
Just like using a band saw was a more automated way than using a hand saw in order to cut material a water jet is even more automated. A water jet is controlled by a computer that we can program to cut any shape we want. It takes an abrasive grit and it mixes it with a high pressure high velocity stream of water that goes through a tiny nozzle to blast through almost any material.
So, today we've looked at using manufacturing processes to make a flower in order of increasing automation we've looked at drilling from a hand drill to a power drill on the way to a computer controlled mill and then for cutting, we've looked at starting with the hand saw, moving to a band saw, on the way up to automated water jet. All of these tools do essentially the same things and at the end of the day, you' ve turned your plain piece of wood into a beautiful flower. Thank goodness manufacturing has become automated and it's moved from hands on to hands off or I might still be here drilling a hole with the hand drill.
What fraction of this circle is shaded red ? So you see this circle is divided into one..two..three..four..five ..six.. seven..eight equal parts and of those eight equal parts, seven are shaded red. So we can say that seven out of eight, are shaded red.
So this diagram over here I have this big triangle and I have all of these other little triangles inside this big triangle What I want to do is see if I can figure out the measure of this angle right here
That goes to zero and it would be negative theta plus 32 degrees is equal to zero You can add theta to both sides and you get 32 degrees is equal to theta Or theta is equa to 32 degrees
오마르는 지난 닷새 간 총 50마일을 배에서 노를 저어 이동했고, 매일 똑같은 거리를 노를 저었다. 오마르는 하루에 몇 마일을 노를 저어 이동했을까? 이제 그냥 상황을 시각화해서 보잔 말입니다. 그는 50마일을 이동할 수 있습니다. 그러니까 이걸 그읍시다_ 이 선이 그가 이동한 50마일을 뜻하는 거라고 가정하죠. 그러니까 여기 있는 이 거리 전부는 50마일입니다. 그리고 그는 이 거리를_ 문제에서 그는 이 거리를 닷새 안에 이동하고, 매일 똑같은 거리를 이동한다고 합니다. 그러니까 이 50마일은 그가 닷새 동안 이동한 모든 거리의 합이라고 볼 수 있겠네요. 그래서 만약 당신이 그가 하루에 얼만큼을 이동했는지 알고 싶다면, 실질적으로 이 50마일을 다섯 개의 동일한 구역으로 나누면 되는 겁니다. 그리고 그 구역들의 길이가 그가 각 날에 이동한 거리가 되게 되는 겁니다. 그러니 우리가 그냥 시각화를 한다면_ 이게 1구역_ 2구역_ 3구역_ 4구역_ 그리고 5구역. 사실, 제가 그렇게 잘하진 못했네요. 이것보다는 조금 더 똑같이 나누어졌어야 하는데 말이죠. 하나, 둘_ (아니, 다섯 구역이 안 되겠네요_ 자) 하나, 둘, 셋, 넷, 그리고 다섯. 이걸 실제로 할 필요는 없습니다. 그냥 시각화를 돕기 위해서 하는 겁니다. 그러니까 결국, 우리가 구하고 싶은 것은 이 구역 중의 하나의 길이죠 그리고 보시다시피 이건 그냥 그 50마일을 가져다가 다섯 개의 똑같은 조각으로 나누는 것일 뿐입니다. 그러니까 결국 그냥 50을 갖다가 5로 나누는 거죠.
We've already seen that a fraction like 2/9 can be interpreted as 2 divided by 9. Let me do the 2 in the same color. That if we have a fraction, it could be interpreted as the numerator divided by the denominator.
Now that we know a little bit about vectors and scalars ... ... let's try to apply what we know about them for some pretty common problems ... ... you'd have once in physics class ... ... but they are also common problems you would see in your everyday life ... ... because you're trying to figure out how far you have gone ... ... or how fast you are going or how long it might take you to get to some place. So first I have: If Shantanu was able to travel 5 kilometer north in 1 hour ... ... in his car, what was his average velocity?
And they also gave a direction. So he moved a distance of 5 km. Distance is the scalar ... ... but if they give the direction too you get the displacement.
That seems like a much more natural first letter.
And my best sense of that is ... ... once you start doing calculus, ... ... you start using "d" for something very different ... ... you use it for the derivative operator. And that's so that the "d"s don't get confused ... ... and thats why we use "s" for displacement.
If someone has a better explanation of that ... ... feel free to comment on this video ... ... and i'll add another video explaining that better explanation. So velocity is your displacement over time. If i wanted to write an analogous thing for the scalar quantities ... ...
Sometimes ... ... - this is also a change in time - ... ... sometimes you'll just see a "t" written there. Sometimes you'll see someone actually put this little triangle ... ... the character "delta" ... ... in front of it.
Which expicitly means "change in". It looks like a very fancy mathematics when you see that. But a triangle in front of something litterally means "change in".
You could have said: Well, his average speed or his rate would be the distance he travels .... ... we don't care about the direction now ... ... it's 5 kilometers ... ... and he does it in 1 hour. His change in time is 1 hour.
And you might say: I could have ... you know, ... ...
So, how many hours are there per second? Or another way to think about it: ... ... one hour - think about the larger unit - ... ... one hour is how many seconds? Well, you have 60 seconds per minute .... ... times 60 minutes per second ... ... the minutes canc... oh Sorry! ... times 60 minutes per hour, I should say ... ... the minutes cancel out .... ...60 times 60 is 3600 ... ...seconds per hour.
Let's add 536 to 398, and we're going to do it two different ways so you really understand what this carrying is all about. So first, we'll do it in the more traditional way. We start in the "one"s place, we say "what's 6 plus 8?"
John: Hi, I'm John Green. This is Crash Course World History and today we're going to discuss 19th century Imperialism.
"Hitherto, all European nations,
"including your own country's barbarian merchants,
"have carried on their trade with our Celestial Empire at Canton.
"Such has been the procedure for many years,
"although our Celestial Empire possesses all things in prolific abundance
"and lacks no product within its own borders." Then Europeans, especially the British found something that the Chinese would buy: Opium.
Commissioner Lin Zexu drafted a response that contained a memorable threat to cut off trade in rhubarb, silk and tea, all valuable products of ours without which foreigners could not live. But even if the British had received this terrifying threat to their precious rhubarb supply, they probably wouldn't have responded because selling drugs is super lucrative. The Chinese made like tea partiers, confiscating a bunch of British opium and chucking it into the sea.
"Man, that seems a little bit harsh." Whereupon the British sent in gunships, opening trade with Canton by force. Chinese General Yijing made a counterattack in 1842 that included a detailed plan to catapult flaming monkeys onto British ships.
Stan, is that true? All right, apparently the plans involved strapping fireworks to monkey's backs and were never carried out, but still. Slightly off-topic.
Burning Bonobos, Immolated Marmoset.
Stan, sometimes I feel like I should give up teaching world history and just become a band name generator. That's my real gift. Anyway, due to lack of monkey fireworks, the Chinese counterattacks were unsuccessful and they eventually signed the Treaty of Nanjing which stated that Britain got Hong Kong and 5 other treaty ports as well as the equivalent of $2 billion in cash.
But eventually, after another war and one of the most destructive civil rebellions in Chinese and possibly world history, the Taiping Rebellion, the situation was reversed and Europeans, especially the British became the dominant economic power in China. Okay, so, but when we think about 19th century imperialism, we usually think about the way that Europe turned Africa from this into this, the so-called Scramble for Africa.
Speaking of scrambles and European colonization of Africa, you know what they say, sometimes to make an omelet, you've got to break a few eggs. Then sometimes, you break a lot of eggs and you don't get an omelet. Europeans had been involved in Africa since the 16th century when the Portuguese used their cannons to take control of cities on coasts to set up their trading post empire.
"C is for Colonies. "Rightly we boast that of all the great countries
"Great Britain has the most." But it was mostly, not to get all Marxist on you or anything, about controlling the means of production. Europeans wanted colonies to secure sources of raw materials, especially cotton, copper, iron and rubber, that were used to fuel their growing industrial economies.
An open letter to Hiram Maxim. But first, let's see what's in the secret compartment today. It's Darth Vader.
Most importantly, among your many inventions was the successful amusement park ride, the Captive Flying Machine.
Mr. Maxim, I hate the Captive Flying Machine.
The Captive Flying Machine has resulted in many a girlfriend telling me that I'm a coward. I'm not a coward! I just don't want to die up there.
Unless you are, wait for it, the Mongols. It's tempting to imagine Europe ruling their colonies with the proverbial topaz fist and while there was always the threat of violence, the truth is a lot more complicated. Let's go to the thought bubble.
Frederick Lugard, who was Britain's head honcho in Nigeria for a time, called this rule through and by the natives. This worked particularly well with British administrators who were primarily middle class men but had aristocratic pretensions and were often pleased to associate with the highest echelons of Indian or African society. Now, this isn't to say that indigenous rulers were simply puppets.
Mahatma Gandhi, for instance, was the son of an Indian high official, which made it possible for him to study law in England. We can't overlook the sheer practicality of it. The alternative was to resist and that usually didn't work out well.
"Whatever happens, we have got the Maxim gun and they have not." But even with this enormous technological advantage, it wasn't always easy. For example, it took 25 years, from 1845 to 1870, for the British to fully defeat the Maori on New Zealand because the Maori were kick-ass fighters who had mastered musketry and defensive warfare.
like the Apaches and the Lakota, a good reminder that the United States did some imperial expansion of its own as part of its nationalizing project in the 19th century. But back to Africa. Sometimes African rulers were so good at adapting European technology that they were able to successfully resist imperialism.
Guiseppe Verdi's Aida for the opening of the Cairo Opera House in 1871.
Guiseppe Verdi, by the way, no relation to John Green.
And Ismail had ambitions of extending Egypt's control up the Nile west toward Lake Chad but to do that, he needed money and that's where he got into trouble. His borrowing bankrupted Egypt and led to Britain's taking control over the country's finances and its shares in the Suez Canal that Ismail had built with French engineers and French capital in 1869.
The British sent in 1,300 bureaucrats to fix Egypt's finances, an invasion of red tape that led to a nationalist uprising which brought on a full scale British intervention after 1881 in order to protect British interests. This business imperialism, as it is sometimes known, is really at the heart of the imperialistic impulse. Industrialized nations push economic integration upon developing nations, and then extract value from those developing nations, just as you would from a mine or a field you owned.
Rewrite the radical expression using rational exponents and simplify. So here we have the fourth root of 5 a to the fourth b to the twelfth power. The key thing to realize here is the fourth root of something is same thing as something to the one fourth power.
In this video we're going to get introduced to the Pythagorean theorem, which is fun on its own. But you'll see as you learn more and more mathematics it's one of those cornerstone theorems of really all of math.
So let's say I have a triangle that looks like that. Let me draw it a little bit nicer. So let's say I have a triangle that looks like that.
So let's say that C is equal to the length of the hypotenuse. So let's call this C-- that side is C. Let's call this side right over here A.
Now the first thing you want to do, before you even apply the Pythagorean theorem, is to make sure you have your hypotenuse straight. You make sure you know what you're solving for.
It's 25. So 25 is equal to C squared. And we could take the positive square root of both sides.
So you take the principal root of both sides and you get 5 is equal to C. Or, the length of the longest side is equal to 5. Now, you can use the Pythagorean theorem, if we give you two of the sides, to figure out the third side no matter what the third side is.
The longest side, the hypotenuse, is right there.
So if we think about the Pythagorean theorem-- that A squared plus B squared is equal to C squared-- 12 you could view as C.
This is the hypotenuse. The C squared is the hypotenuse squared. So you could say 12 is equal to C.
And then we could say that these sides, it doesn't matter whether you call one of them A or one of them B.
So let's just call this side right here. Let's say A is equal to 6. And then we say B-- this colored B-- is equal to question mark.
And now we can apply the Pythagorean theorem. A squared, which is 6 squared, plus the unknown B squared is equal to the hypotenuse squared-- is equal to C squared.
Is equal to 12 squared. And now we can solve for B. And notice the difference here.
In the last example we solved for the hypotenuse. We solved for C.
So that's why it's always important to recognize that A squared plus B squared plus C squared, C is the length of the hypotenuse.
So let's just solve for B here. So we get 6 squared is 36, plus B squared, is equal to 12 squared-- this 12 times 12-- is 144. Now we can subtract 36 from both sides of this equation.
On the left-hand side we're left with just a B squared is equal to-- now 144 minus 36 is what?
So this is going to be 108.
So that's what B squared is, and now we want to take the principal root, or the positive root, of both sides. And you get B is equal to the square root, the principal root, of 108. Now let's see if we can simplify this a little bit.
And what we could do is we could take the prime factorization of 108 and see how we can simplify this radical.
So 108 is the same thing as 2 times 54, which is the same thing as 2 times 27, which is the same thing as 3 times 9. So we have the square root of 108 is the same thing as the square root of 2 times 2 times-- well actually, I'm not done.
And this is all an exercise in simplifying radicals that you will bump into a lot while doing the Pythagorean theorem, so it doesn't hurt to do it right here. So this is the same thing as the square root of 2 times 2 times 3 times 3 times the square root of that last 3 right over there. And this is the same thing.
Thank you.... thank you so much.
Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of
Force Base and welcomed home some of our last troops to serve in Iraq. Together, we offered a final, proud salute to the colors under which more than a million of our fellow citizens fought -- and several thousand gave their lives.

No, we will not go back to an economy weakened by outsourcing, bad debt, and phony financial profits. Tonight, I want to speak about how we move forward, and lay out a blueprint for an economy that's built to last -- an economy built on American manufacturing, American energy, skills for

 We're asked which of these lines are parallel. So they give us three equations of three different
We're almost in slope-intercept form, we can just divide both sides of this equation by 2. We get y is equal to 6x-- right, 12 divided by 2 -- 6x plus 5. So our slope in this case, we have it in slope-intercept form, our slope in this case is equal to 6.
So the point negative 2, 2, is being represented here because you're subtracting the points. And the slope is 6, so we already know that the slope is equal to 6. And sometimes people are more comfortable with slope-intercept form, so let's put it in slope-intercept form just to confirm that if we put it in this form, the slope will still be equal to 6.
Back in New York, I am the head of development for a non-profit called Robin Hood.
When I'm not fighting poverty, I'm fighting fires as the assistant captain of a volunteer fire company. Now in our town, where the volunteers supplement a highly skilled career staff, you have to get to the fire scene pretty early to get in on any action. I remember my first fire.
let's call him Lex Luther -- (Laughter) got to the captain first and was asked to go inside and save the homeowner's dog. The dog! I was stunned with jealousy.
In both my vocation at Robin Hood and my avocation as a volunteer firefighter, I am witness to acts of generosity and kindness on a monumental scale, but I'm also witness to acts of grace and courage on an individual basis. And you know what I've learned?
Save the shoes.
Mark Bezos: Thank you.
Let's see if we can write 1.501 as a percentage. Now, we really just want to write this quantity, as something over 100. So, what we can do is, we can say that this is the same thing as 1.501 over 1.

Papuans should work hard to develop themselves They must build Papua according to what they believe
Papua today can't be separated from the various conflicts it faces There's the conflict of interests, where Papuans ... clash with the Indonesian government particularly regarding political interests And like it or not, the battles over money in Papua ... will turn the people into victims
The development policies implemented in Papua have failed to 'Indonesianise' the Papuans They have failed to dignify the society [Jakarta way] but instead they marginalise the people, and Papuans become poor in their rich land
Don't view the problems in Papua as 'Christian problems' because Christians are the majority This is not a religious problem, this a case for humanity It's about the humans
Muslim Papuans are integral part of West Papua Muslims also suffer and are marginalised by the development processes Muslim believers from everywhere must also pay attention to Papua

We always hear that texting is a scourge. The idea is that texting spells the decline and fall of any kind of serious literacy, or at least writing ability, among young people in the United States and now the whole world today. The fact of the matter is that it just isn't true, and it's easy to think that it is true, but in order to see it in another way, in order to see that actually texting is a miraculous thing, not just energetic, but a miraculous thing, a kind of emergent complexity that we're seeing happening right now, we have to pull the camera back for a bit and look at what language really is, in which case, one thing that we see is that texting is not writing at all.
"The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire:"
"The whole engagement lasted above twelve hours, till the graduate retreat of the Persians was changed into a disorderly flight, of which the shameful example was given by the principal leaders and the Surenas himself." That's beautiful, but let's face it, nobody talks that way. Or at least, they shouldn't if they're interested in reproducing.
"Ahem, ladies and gentlemen," and then they speak in a certain way which has nothing to do with casual speech. It's formal. It uses long sentences like this Gibbon one.
The Gettysburg Address was not the main meal of that event. For two hours before that, Edward Everett spoke on a topic that, frankly, cannot engage us today and barely did then. The point of it was to listen to him speaking like writing.
And so, for example, there is in texting a convention, which is LOL. Now LOL, we generally think of as meaning "laughing out loud." And of course, theoretically, it does, and if you look at older texts, then people used it to actually indicate laughing out loud.
"I love the font you're using, btw." Julie: "lol thanks gmail is being slow right now" Now if you think about it, that's not funny.
Susan: "lol, I have to write a 10 page paper." She's not amused. Let's think about it.
LOL is being used in a very particular way. It's a marker of empathy. It's a marker of accommodation.
Now, we can use slash in the way that we're used to, along the lines of, "We're going to have a party-slash-networking session." That's kind of like what we're at. Slash is used in a very different way in texting among young people today.
"So I need to find people to chill with" and Jake says, "Haha" -- you could write a dissertation about "Haha" too, but we don't have time for that —
"Haha so you're going by yourself? Why?" Sally:
"For this summer program at NYU." Jake: Slash I'm watching this video with suns players trying to shoot with one eye."
It's not as sophisticated as the language of The Wall Street Journal. Well, the fact of the matter is, look at this person in 1956, and this is when texting doesn't exist,
"I Love Lucy" is still on the air.
"Many do not know the alphabet or multiplication table, cannot write grammatically -- " We've heard that sort of thing before, not just in 1956. 1917, Connecticut schoolteacher.
This is the time when we all assume that everything somehow in terms of writing was perfect because the people on "Downton Abbey" are articulate, or something like that. So, "From every college in the country goes up the cry,
'Our freshmen can't spell, can't punctuate.'" And so on. You can go even further back than this.
"Bad spelling, incorrectness as well as inelegance of expression in writing." And he's talking about people who are otherwise well prepared for college studies. You can go even further back.
If somebody from 1973 looked at what was on a dormitory message board in 1993, the slang would have changed a little bit since the era of "Love Story," but they would understand what was on that message board.
Take that person from 1993 -- not that long ago, this is "Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure" -- those people. Take those people and they read a very typical text written by a 20-year-old today. Often they would have no idea what half of it meant because a whole new language has developed among our young people doing something as mundane as what it looks like to us when they're batting around on their little devices.
So in closing, if I could go into the future, if I could go into 2033, the first thing I would ask is whether David Simon had done a sequel to "The Wire." I would want to know.
And — I really would ask that — and then I'd want to know actually what was going on on "Downton Abbey." That'd be the second thing. And then the third thing would be, please show me a sheaf of texts written by 16-year-old girls, because I would want to know where this language had developed since our times, and ideally I would then send them back to you and me now so we could examine this linguistic miracle happening right under our noses.
 We're asked to use the drop-down to form a linear equation with infinitely many solutions. So an equation with infinitely many solutions essentially has the same thing on both sides, no matter what x you pick.
So if we make this a negative 8, this is going to be true for any x you pick. You give me any x, you multiply it by 5 and subtract 8, that's, of course, going to be that same x multiplied by 5 and subtracting 8.
And if you were to try to somehow solve this equation, subtract 5x from both sides, you would get negative 8 is equal to negative 8, which is absolutely true for absolutely any x that you pick.
So let's go-- let me actually fill this in on the exercise. So I want to make 5-- it's going to be 5x plus negative 8.
Well, I'm involved in other things, besides physics. In fact, mostly now in other things. One thing is distant relationships among human languages.
Chris Anderson: Do you have a hunch or a hope for what the answer to that is?
Well, I would guess that modern language must be older than the cave paintings and cave engravings and cave sculptures and dance steps in the soft clay in the caves in Western Europe, in the Aurignacian Period some 35,000 years ago, or earlier.
CA: Well, Philip Anderson may have been right. You may just know more about everything than anyone.
Plot the following numbers on the number line. So the first number we have here is five. And so five is five to the right of zero.
What's happening to the climate? It is unbelievably bad. This is, obviously, that famous view now of the Arctic, which is likely to be gone at this point in the next three or four or five years.
And it was something called EcoRock. And we said we could redesign the 115-year-old gypsum drywall process that generates 20 billion pounds of CO2 a year. So it was a big idea.
We happened to win, just recently, the Green Product of the Year for "The Re-Invention of Drywall," from Popular Science. Thank you. Thank you.
When they have their kids, 2050, they'd better look back at Grandpa and say, "Hey, you gave it a good shot. You did the best you could with the team that you had."
Male 1: The whole period of the American Revolution and the establishment of the country, of the government, can get very muddled in people's minds. What I was hoping we could cover in this video is unmuddle that, separate out the events and see how they all fit together.
Male 2:
Let's start in 1775 because that's when the rebellion really begins.
That's when you have the Battles of Lexington and Concord and Paul Revere riding to say that the British are coming.
They started to rebel against the taxes that Parliament has but on us. They're not quite clear what the rebellion is all about, especially those people who aren't up there in Massachusetts where the rebels are happening.
This is really around this idea the Declaration of Independence is really, look, we're already essentially at war.
Male 2: What they were during this war of independence were 13 separate states.
Male 1: Yeah, we have it right here. Actually,
Oh, I mean it's like something written by a bad template.
Male 1: To whom it may concern! (laughs)
Male 2: It's not an inspiring document and it gives no power to a central government. As you say, it's the Delegates of the States.
Male 1: The Federal, the central government, does not directly, there's no Federal income tax, or not any tax of any kind, not even any kind of tax. The States can tax in whatever way they see fit and then they have to give something.
Male 2: What's kind of amusing is we win the Revolution in the Battle of Yorktown.
Male 1: It's obviously not a perfect analogy, but if we take analogy to present-day, it's kind of what's happening in Europe where there's these separate nations, separate States, that are trying to form some type of union, not clear who has what power. The Central European Union is not directly taxing.
Male 2: Precisely. That's a very good analogy to what was happening because they weren't quite clear whether they had a central currency or not back then.
Male 1: Considering that this is not the governing document for us now, something must have broken to want to replace it.
By the time you're getting into 1786, it is totally clear that this document isn't working.
Like Maryland and Virginia are having this horrible dispute over navigation and border rights. They call an Annapolis Convention to try to fix that up and they try to get the States to come. Only five of them come.
You have something up in Massachusetts called Shays' Rebellion where there was this rebellion of the poor farmers in western Massachusetts under a former Revolutionary War officer named Daniel Shays.
It's sort of unclear what ...
Male 1: His name was Shays?
Male 2: Yeah. S-H-A-Y-S.
Male 1: So it's Shays, the apostrophe's after ...
Male: The apostrophe's after, yeah. Daniel Shays was his name.
So the poor people of Massachusetts have to try to raise a militia to try to stop Shays' Rebellion, but they can't get the Federal government to step in. It was just one of many, many symptoms that we were all disintegrating and falling apart. There was no rule of law that governed all the colonies, and now all the States.
Male 1: This makes it clear that even after
Shays' Rebellion, even after these border disputes between Maryland and Virginia, it still wasn't a done deal. A lot of States still liked their autonomy, liked their independence. So even going into this, it wasn't like everyone was unanimously saying hey, we need to give the federal government more power.
Male 2: And by the way, what does that sound like? It sounds like the debates we're having today.
Male 1: Exactly! (chuckles)
Male 2: We still, as a nation, have always had these debates of how much power should be given to the central government, how much power should retain with the States, whether it's on healthcare or our laws or our taxation. It's a useful tension to have.
Then they are able to come up with a solution.
Male 2: It's a very difficult problem of the big States wanting there to be proportional representation in a new Congress, the small States wanting equal votes per State.
"To all to whom these presents shall come."
Male 1:
(laughing)To whom it may concern!
Male 2: Let's look at the Preamble to the constitution.
Male 1: "We the people of the United States." That's as opposed to "To whom it may concern."
Male 2: Just look at those first three words. I mean those first three words are totally an inspiring thing.
It's never been done before, which is "We the people" are getting to create this Constitution. It's not the States getting together to do it. It's not the king devolving authority.
It's "We the people" gathered together here. We are the ones that are going to ordain, a nice religious word down there, "ordain." "Do ordain and establish."
It's not coming from the divine right of kings or God, we the people get to ordain and establish this constitution.
Male 1: We've made previous videos about the Declaration of Independence. The Articles of Confederation in no way share any of the spirit or the poetry of the Declaration, while this Preamble does.
Male 2: Yeah, let's read it. "We the people
"of the United States, in order to form a more "perfect union." That's a very transcendent phrase, but it also means, hey, the Articles of Confederation, we weren't really unified. We have to create a united States.
Male 1: And the "more perfect," is that a direct reference to the Articles that that was a less perfect, or is this something else?
Male 2: It's not a very good piece of grammar. As you know, things are either perfect or they're not.
"general welfare" phrase and say whether it's healthcare or anything else, maybe there are things the central government does that promote the "general welfare." Then we get to the inspiring lines, the poetry as opposed to "To all whom these presents shall come." That's "secure the blessings of liberty to
Male 1: Previously I think the "U" wasn't capitalized.
Yeah, in some of the earlier documents it wasn't and we certainly were not united.
It's only under this Constitution do we become, really, the United States of America.
The solution was found by another British mathematician and cryptographer Clifford Cocks. Cocks needed to construct a special kind of one-way function, called the trapdoor one-way function. This is a function that is easy to compute in one direction, yet difficult to reverse, unless you have special information called the trap door.
For this he turned to modular exponentiation, which we introduced as clock arithmetic in the Diffie-Hellman key exchange as follows:
Take a number, raise it to some exponent, divide by the modulus and output the ramainder. This could be used to encrypt a message as follows:
Imagine Bob has a message, which is converted into a number m. He then multiplies his number by itself e times, where e is a public exponent. Then he divides the result by random number N and outputs the remainder of the division.
Now, what about the key? The key is the trap door, some piece of information, that makes it easy to reverse the encryption.
We need to raise c to some other exponent, say d, which will undo the initial operation applied to m and return the original message m.
So both operations together is the same as m to the power of e, all raised to the power of d, which is the same as m to the power of e times d, e is the encryption d is the decryption.
Therefore we need a way for Alice to construct e and d, which makes it difficult for anyone else to find d. This requires a second one-way function, which is used for generating d and for this he looked back to Euclid...
When people use the word "perimeter" in everyday language they're talking about the boundary of some area. And when we're talking about perimeter in math, we're talking about a related idea but now we're not only talking about the boundary, we're actually talking about the length of the boudary, how far do you have to go round the boundary to essentially go completely around a figure, completely go round the area. So let's look at this first triangle right over here.
Giles: My name is Giles Shih.
I'm President and CEO of BioResource International. People ask me, "Does your PhD help you as you grow your business?" I think more than anything, the persistence, and perseverance, the discipline of just day in, day out going after something, and setting goals and achieving them.
I think a lot of people that go through that PhD process, will tell you, you have to really be driven, and have to be detail-oriented, and you have to deliver a product, a dissertation at the end, and defend it in front of your professors and your peers. I think the training has helped me, to develop more of a long term view, in being persistent and diligent. I'm not the first one to say this, but usually when you start a business, there's three elements that need to happen.
"Why are we doing this?"
"What impact does it have?"
Ask, "Why?" Then, if there's something that really gets you going, something that becomes personal and a cause for you, pursue that and harness that and go with it. I think that will get you through a lot of the difficulties and challenges.
 Make a table and solve. A biologist is researching the impact of three different water-based sugar drinks on bees ability to make honey.
I guess the solution is water. So it's 1.2 liters of water. There's no sugar in Drink B.
What was the translation applied to move the blue solid shape to the orange dashed shape?
I was thinking about my place in the universe, and about my first thought about what infinity might mean, when I was a child. And I thought that if time could reach forwards and backwards infinitely, doesn't that mean that every point in time is really infinitely small, and therefore somewhat meaningless. So we don't really have a place in the universe, as far as on a time line.
(Applause) Thank you. (Applause)
(Applause)
For those of you who I'll be fortunate enough to meet afterwards, you could please refrain from saying,
"Oh my god, you're so much shorter in real life." (Laughter) Because it's like the stage is an optical illusion, for some reason.
(Applause) Thank you very much.
What i want to do with this video is step through the program that we wrote in the previous video to really understand what's happening line-by-line you get a little bit of an intuitive understanding for for-loops and variables and we're going to do it for a specific example we're going to do an example where the user inputs so when the user's prompted to input a number the user will input the number "3" we're just going to assume that and i've picked a low number so that we don't have to keep looping through this forever so this video can be of a reasonable length so right when that happens when the user inputs the number "3" it assigns the variable number to be equal to "3" and there's 2 ways that you can think about this i tend do when i do in any programming language when i think of a variable i tend to view it as a bucket so i have a bucket called number and in that bucket, when the user inputs a "3", if the user inputs a "3" i'm sticking a "3" in that bucket Python is a little bit different than some languages and the more correct way and they're both kind of intuitive, if you think about it, a viewing a variable in Python is to think of the variable as referring to the 3 and i say that, because in Python, if you change a variable's ĺet's say right under this we wrote numbers equal to 2 but we didn't do that, but if we said numbers equal to 2, what Python does is it actually leaves that 3 there in memory and then it would then point to the number 2 instead, it wouldn't obliterate the 3 and just put a 2 there the 3 still exists, and that's important when we start doing more complex or nuanced things with more fancy data types but let's rewind all of this, for the sake of this program you can view it either way a bucket with a 3 in it or you can view it as a label that is referring to a 3 someplace in the computer's memory now, the next thing that happens is that we have another variable called product, and we assign product to be equal to 1 so i'm gonna do the same two representations so we've set up another bucket here called product and we're putting 1 in that bucket or you could say that product is a variable, it's a label that is referring to a 1, and then we get to our for-loop, and this is probably the confusing part so we have "for i in range(number)", and number in this case so literally the interper say "what's the number" , well in this case the number is 3 so this is going to be evaluated as range of 3 this is going to be evaluated as "range of 3" in our particular example and once again, how did the interpret know that? it said range of number number's a variable, look up number variable, okay, 3 sitting in it so i'm going to put a 3 right in there or look up the number variable, the number variable is pointing to the number 3 so i'm just going to put a 3 here and take a range of 3 and we saw in the last video, that if you evaluate just range of 3 range of 3 is equal to a sequence of numbers 0,1,2, so it creates a sequence of 3 numbers, starting at 0, up to that number -1 and what the for-loop does, is every time we go through the for-loop it executes this code, that's inside the for-loop and we know it's inside the for-loop, because we indented it and the most used convention in Python is that you don't use the tab, you press space 4 times, and that tells the interpreter anything at this level in indention happened every time we go to the for-loop and when we start the for-loop, the i-variable is going to start at 0 so the first time we go to the for-loop, i is going to be the first element in this sequence, then when we go to the for-loop again i is going to be the second element of the sequence and then when we go to the for-loop again, i is going to be the third element in the sequence, and then we go to the for-loop, and it will try to assign i to another element in the sequence and say "hey, wait, there are no more element in the sequence" and then it will break out of the for-loop, and then continue on with the rest of the program so given that, let's think about what happens for the particular example, where the user inputed a 3 so range of number is going to evaluate as 0,1,2
so it's going to be 0,1,2 and the first time into the loop, i, so i'm going to use this convention right over here, the first time through the loop, i is going to refer to the 0 or if we use this convention over here, the first time, as we go through the loop i, could be viewed as a bucket, that is going to be assigned to the first element of the range of 3 the first element of the sequence it is going to be 0 and then we execute what's in the loop we assign, we reassign product to be something new right over here and what is this something new? the first time we go through the for-loop i is 0, 0+1 is 1, so the first time through the loop, this is going to be 1 product is 1, this is the first time we go through the loop, let me do it in the same color so i is 0+1, so we get 1, 1x1 is 1, so product will be assigned to be 1 so product will be reassigned to be 1 which really isn't going to change anything, because it's already 1 so it was 1 before we multiplied it by 1 and reassigned it to be 1 so i could cross out 1, it's not going to be 1 again, but i'll just leave it as 1 or we can just say it's going to be reassigned to be 1, so nothing really has changed that first time through the loop but now interesting things are going to happen so now we'll go back to the beginning of the loop, and now "i" will be the next element in the loop, so now "i", it will be reassigned to be the next element in the loop so now "i" will be 1, that's what the for-loop does, it makes "i" each of the items in the sequence in order, going through them, and now we execute it again now we go look at product times "i" + 1 product is still 1, "i" is now 1, so 1+1 is now going to be 2 so 1 times 2 is going to be our new product so the new product, it was 1, for now we're multiplying it by 2 and assigning it again to product so the new product is now going to be 2 so the product variable is now 2 and then now we try to loop again and now this time, "i" will be the next element
"i" is going to be the next element in the sequence right over here, or we could say that "i" is going to be reassigned to 2, the next element in the sequence, and we try to evaluate it again so now, we go into the for-loop, product is now 2, "i" is now 2 2+1 is 3, so this whole expression over here is 3, so we have 2, product is now 2 times "i" + 1, "i" is 2, so "i"+1 is 3 so you have 2 times 3 is now going to be 6 so the new product times "i" + 1 is now 6, so this is now going to be 6 and now we try to execute the for-loop again, and the for-loop is going to say
"hey, let me reassign "i" to be the next item in the sequence" it tries to find the next item in the sequence, but it says
"wait, there is no next item in the sequence" so we're done executing our for-loop so there's nothing left in our sequence, we're done with our for-loop now we break out of it, and we go to the next line in the program so the next line in the program is literally just "print the product" and at this point, we just want to output the product and the variable product is now 6 the variable product is now 6 actually, one thing i should have done this entire time is, i was sticking with the bucket representation, but the product here is starting to referring to 1, it got reassigned to 1, but then it got assigned to 2, so then this reference went to 2, and then it got reassigned to to 6 then it got reassigned to 6, so if i were to be consistent with this representation over here, every time product is referring to another number, or it can be viewed as a bucket, for the sake of this program, where it keeps getting reassigned, and what's cool about this, is when we're done with this for-loop, the number that's sitting in the bucket product, the variable product, or you could say, the number that the variable product is referring to, is the factorial of the number that the person inputed it's the factorial of 3, and if you remember, 3, the symbol for factorial is an exclamation mark, is equal to 3 times 2 times 1

We are told that the formula for finding the perimeter of a rectangle is P is equal to 2l plus 2w, where P is the perimeter, I is the length, and w is the width.
And just to visualize what they're saying, and you might already be familiar with this, let me draw a rectangle. That looks like a rectangle. And if this side's length is l, then this side's length is also going to be l.
And so, that distance is going to be this w plus this I, plus this w-- or that width-- plus this length. And if you have 1 w and you add it to another w, that's going to give you 2 w's.
So that's 2 w's. And then if you have 1 I, and then you have another l, that's going to give you, if you add them together, that's going to give you 2 I's.
So the perimeter is going to be 2 I's plus 2 w's. They just wrote it in a different order than the way I wrote it. But the same thing, so hopefully that makes sense.
They want us to write it so it's, this w, right here, they want it to be w is equal to a bunch of stuff with I's and P's in it, and maybe some numbers there. So let's think about how we can do this.
And to get rid of it on that side of the equation, we could subtract the 2l from both sides of the equation. So let's do it this way. So you subtract 2l over here.
So if you subtract 2l from this, you're going to have to subtract 2l from P in order for the equality to keep being true. So the left-hand side is going to be P minus 2l, and then that is going to be equal to-- well, 2l minus 2l, the whole reason why we subtracted 2l is because these are going to cancel out. So these cancel out, and you're just
We've almost solved for w. To finish it up, we just have to divide both sides of this equation by 2.
And the whole reason why I'm dividing both sides of this equation by 2 is to get rid of this 2 coefficient, this 2 that's multiplying w. So if you divide both sides of this equation by 2, once again, if you do something to one side of the equation, you do it to the other side. The whole reason why I divided the right-hand side by 2 is 2 times anything divided by 2 is just going to be that anything, so this is going to be a w.
So if you divide both sides of this equation by 2, these 2's are going to cancel out-- 2 times anything divided by 2 is just going to be the anything-- is equal to P over 2.
So let me just rewrite this over here. Let me just rewrite this. So we will get P over 2 is going to be equal to I plus w.
 In the last video, we talked a little bit about compounding interest. Our example was interest that compounds annually, not continuously like we would see in a lot of banks.
This you could also say, x is equal to log base 10 of 2, divided by log base 1.1 of 2. This is another way to calculate log base 1.1 of 2. This should be log base 10 of 1.1.
logarithm of that, 0.3, divided by 1.1, and the logarithm of that. We close the parentheses.
 Simplify n squared r to the fifth n to the negative seventh.
Express your answer in exponential form with positive exponents. Let me just rewrite what they have up there. So we have n squared r to the fifth n to the negative seventh.
We've simplified it and all of the exponents are now positive because we put the n in the denominator.
Եկեք մի փոքր խոսենք բջջի կառուցվածքի մասին
Ես շատ տեսհոլովակներ եմ պատրաստել, որտեղ առնչություն եմ ունեցել այս թեմայի մասին, բայց երբեք չեմ խոսել ամբողջ կառուցվածքի մասին:
Շատ լավ ժամանակ է սկսել--եկեք գծեմ թաղանթ
Շատ լավ է քննարկումը սկսել բջջային թաղանթից հենց սրա շնորհից է բջիջը բաժանվում արտաքին աշխարհից, հիմնականում թաղանթն է նկարագրում բջիջը
Նկարագրում է այս շատ փոքրիկ բաժանմունքը այդտեղից էլ բջիջ բառն է առաջացել:
Եկեք դա նշեմ բջջային թաղանթ
Եվ բոլոր բջիջները ունեն բջջային թաղանթ
Եթե մտածենք ամենակարևորը բանը ինչ սահմանում է բջիջը, դու հավանաբար տեսել եք ԴՆԹ-ի տեսահոլովակներում և մենք կխոսենք տրանսիլացիայի և տրանսկրիպցիայի մասին ու այն ամենը:
Ինչն է սահմանում կենդանի օրգանիզմը, իր ԴՆԹ-ն է: Այսպիսով բոլոր բջիջներն ունեն իրենց ԴՆԹ:
Ես շատ չեմ խորանա, թե ինչպես է ԴՆԹ-ն սահմանվում ինչ է կենդանի օրգանիզմը:
ԴՆԹ-ի տեսահոլովակում խոսել եմ այդ ամենի մասին: Բայց բոլոր բջիջներն ունեն ԴՆԹ: Սա ավելի շատ ԴՆԹ-ի անատոմիա է , քան ֆունկցիան, բայց մենք կանդրադառնանք ֆունկցիային, քանի որ մենք կարիք ունենք իմանալու առանձին մասերի գործունեությունը
Եվ այսպես, աջ կողմում, ԴՆԹ-ն է
Եվ այստեղ քրոմատին է առաջանում Այստեղ նաև կան փոքրիկ սպիտակուցներ
Ոչ բոլոր կենդանի օրգանիզմներում, բայց մենք ավելի շատ կենտրոնանալու ենք էուկարիոտներին, և մի փոքր խոսելու են էուկարիոտ և պրոկարիոտ բջիջների տարբերությունը
Բայց մենք ունենք ԴՆԹ
Ահա իմ նկարած բջիջը, հիմնականում բոլոր բջիջները, ցանկացած կենդանի կամ բույսի կամ ցանկացած թագավորության այսպիսի տեսք ունեն
Ես շատ մանրամասն չեմ նկարել: Ես նոր նկարեցի ԴՆԹ-ն և բջջային թաղանթը
Ահա, այստեղ տեղի է ունենում հիմնական բաժանումը կենդանի աշխարհում, դիտելով մեր տեսանկյունից, կամ դա թվում է սովորական, որ որոշ բջիջներ ունեն թաղանթ ԴՆԹ-ի շուրջ
Այսպիսով նրանք ունեն թաղանթ ԴՆԹ-ի շուրջ, որը առանձնացնում է
ԴՆԹ-ն և քրոմատինը և ամեն բան ինչ կապված է ԴՆԹ-ի հետ, առանձնացված է բջջի այլ մասերից և կոչվում է կորիզ
Սա կոչվում է կորիզ:
Եվ ես ասացի, որ սա հիմնականում բաժանումն է, քանի որ երբ որոշ մարդիկ նայում են որոշ բջիջներին և տեսնում են կորիզ և մեկ այլ բջիջներ ու չեն տեսնում կորիզը, նրանք ասում են, թե սա լավ միջոց է դասակարգելու օրգանիզմները:
Այսպիսով նրանք անվանեցին որոշներին, ովքեր ունեն կորզիներ, էուկարիոտներ
Սա ունի բջիջ պրոկարիորտ առանց կորիզի
Եվ պրոկարիոտի օրինակներն են, երկու մեծ խմբի են բաժանվում
Բակտերիաներ և Արքեաներ
Ահա, արքեաները շատ հետաքրքիր են մենք շատ քիչ գիտենք նրանց մասին
Կարծիք կա, որ նրանք բակտերիաներից են առաջացել, բայց հիմա մարդիկ հասկանում են, որ գոյություն ունի ընդհանրապես առանձին այլ խումբ, և մենք հայտանաբերել ենք դրա շատ փոքր մասը նրանց ենթատեսակը, ահա, սա շատ հետաքրքիր խումբ է
Եվ իրականում պարզվում է, էվոլուցիոն տեսանկյունից , որ կարիք չկա բաժանումներ անել. Դա իրականում
Դա ավելի կիրառելի էուկարիոտ բջիջների տեսակները բաժանել, ես ուղղակի գրեմ Էուկարիոտ, բակտերիա և արքեա
Այստեղ իրականում երեք առանձին խմբեր կան որոնցից կսկսենք
Այս ամենի մասին կխոսենք հետագա վիդեոներում
Բայց եթե ուզում ես հարցնես, ինչը ունի կորիզ
Լավ, սահմանումից ելնելով էուկարիոտները ունեն կորիզ Ինչը չունի կորիզ
Լավ, բակտերիաները և արքեաները չունեն կորիզ ընհամենը այդքանը
Բայց ես կենտրոնանալու եմ էուկարիոտների վրա, քանի որ նրանք մի փոքր ավելի բարդ կառուցվածք ունեն
Հիմնականում ինչի մասին խոսում ենք, ամենաքիչը մեր վիդեոներում վերաբերում են էուկարիոտներին
Էուկարիոտներ են բույսերը, կենդանիները: Մենք կենդանիներ են, հենց օրինակ ես: Կենդանիները և սնկերը, և կան նաև այլ խմբեր էուկարիոտիների մեջ, բայց սրանք այն հիմնական խմբերն են որոնք հետ առնչվում ենք մեր առօրյա կյանքում:
Բայց եկեք նորից խոսենք բջջի անատոմիայի մասին: Ահա մենք ունենք ԴՆԹ:
Մենք գիտենք, որ այն փոխակերպվում է ի-ՌՆԹ-ի, այդ ի-ՌՆԹ-ն լքում է կորիզը և փոխակերպվում է սպիտակուցների ռիբոսոմի մեջ: Ահա ռիբոսոմները այս փոքրիկ կոմպլեքսներն են, որոնք կարող պտտվել բջջի շուրջը, և մենք կտեսնենք նաև, որ նրանք նաև կարող ենք կցված լինել այլ կառուցվածքների թաղանթներին.
Ահա սա ռիբոսոմ է:
Եվ եթե այս ամբողջ խոսակցությունը ԴՆԹ-ի փոխակերպումը ի-ՌՆԹ-ի և ի-ՌՆԹ-ի լքումը կորիզից և տեղափոխումը ռիբոսոմներ սպիտակուցի վերածվելու համար որևէ կերպ օգտակար չեղավ, այստեղ կան վիդեոներ, որոնց մասին ավելի մանրամասն կխոսեմ:
Բայց ես ցանկանում եմ կենտրոնանալ տարբեր parts to kind of give a big picture of things.
Այսպիսով ռիբոսոմը այն վայրն է, որտեղ ի-ՌՆԹ-ն, որը գրառվել էր կորիզում ԴՆԹ-ից, փոխակերպվում է սպիտակուցի:
Այսպիսով դու կարող ես նրանց դիտել մի վայլ, որտեղ ինֆորմացիան փոխակերպվում է սպիտակուցի, որը կարող է կիրառվել բջջի տարբեր մասերում:
Եվ այս ռիբոսոմները կազմված կազմված են սպիտակուցներից, և իրականում նրանք կազմվել են ՌՆԹ-ից: Մեկ հարց է առաջանում, որտեղ են ռիբոսոմները կազմվում
Որոշները կազմված են սպիտակուցներից, որոնք հավանաբար կազմվել են այլ ռիբոսոմներում:
Բայց նրանց մի մասը, ի-ՌՆԹ-ն, ռիբոսոմները, դու նրանց կարող ես դիտել, որպես մի մեծ խառնափնթորիկ, եթե դու նրանց ուսումնասիրես մանրամասնորեն:
Եվ ես նրանց չեմ նկարում իրական տեսքով, բայց հետո դու կունենաս ի-ՌՆԹ կապված սպիտակուցի հետ, և ի-ՌՆԹ-ն իրականում չի օգտագործվում տեղեկատվական նպատակի համար normally is when it goes from DNA to the ribosome.
Ռիբոսոմի մեջ, ռիբոսոմային ՌՆԹ-ն իրականում օգտագործում է որպես կառուցվածքի մաս:
Իրականում այն օգնում է ռիբոսոմին գործել որպես ռիբոսոմ:
Այն իրականում ռիբոսոմի մաս է կազմում:
Եվ նրանք բոլորը ստեղծվում են կորիզի մեջ գտնվող կորիզակում:
Եկեք գրեմ այդ բառը: Ահա աջ կողմում, հետաքրքիր է ահա այստեղ:
Սա կորիզակ է կամ nucleole
Եվ սա առանձին օրգան չէ, և թաղանթով առանձնացված չէ, բայց մանրադիտակով տեսանելի է:
Երբ մարդիկ առաջին անգամ տեսան կորիզակ, ասացին, լսեք, այստեղ ինչ-որ կապոց կա: Դա հավանաբար պետք է լինի բջջի միջուկը կամ նմանատիպ բան:
Բայց ինչ պարզվեց, որ շատ խիտ փաթեթավորված է ինչպես ԴՆԹ և ՌՆԹ իրավիճակում, դա իրականում ռիբոսոմային ՌՆԹ է, հումք, որտեղ կազմվում են ռիբոսոմներ, ավելի ճիշտ արտադրվում:
Բայց դա այնքան խիտ էր երևում մանրադիտակով, որի պատճառով մարդիկ որոշեցին մեկ այլ անվանում տալ:
Դա օրգանոիդ չէ օրգանոիդի մեջ:
Դա պարզապես քիչ պաթաթված սպիտակուցներ են և ռիբոսոմային ՌՆԹ և սա այն տեղն է, որտեղ արտադրվում է ռիբոսոմային ՌՆԹ-ն:
Ինչևէ, մենք կանգնեցինք ռիմոբոսմների վրա: Սա այն վայրն է, որտեղ սպիտակուցներ են արտադրվում: Բայց ռիբոսոմները ուղղակի պտտվում են, եթե նրանք ազատ ռիբոսոմներ են, հետո այդ սպիտակուցները, որոնք արտադրվեցին ռիբոսոմի վրա, կպտտվեն այստեղ բջջի հեղուկ մասսայում դա մենք կոչում ենք ցիտոպլազմա
Իսկ եթե մենք ցանկանանք սպիտակուց արտադրել, որոնք ենթադրենք մինչև, երևի բջջի թաղանթը, կամ կամ ենթադրենք բջջից դուրս
Բջիջները արտադրում են մասնիկներ, որոնք օգտագործվում են այլ բջիջների կողմիվ, որոնք օգտագործվում են մարմնի այլ մասերի համար
Եվ այստեղ մենք պետք է գնանք դեպի սպիտակուց, որոնք կցված են թաղանթին այս թաղանթին
Կարող ես դիտել սա որպես թունելների փունջ
Տեսնենք ինչպես կստացվի իմ նկարը Ես պատրաստվում եմ այն շատ վատ նկարել:
Դու ունես այսպիսի բաներ, որոնք կոչվում են էնդոպլազմային ցանց:
Էնդոպլազմային ցանց:
Կարող ես նրանց դիտել որպես խողովակների խուրց:
Էնդոպլազմային ցանց:
Եվ որոնք ի վերջո տանում են դեպի Գոլջիի ապարատ:
Ի պատից պարոն Գոլջիի:
Ահա, էնդոպլազմային ցանցը կանեմ դեղինով և
Գոլջիի ապարատը կանաչով, այ այսպես Հետո կբացարտեմ ինչ են իրենցից ներկայացնում:
Այսպիսով, ինչ է տեղի ունենում: Սա ինչ-որ մեծ կույտ է կամ կարող ես տեսնել սա փաթաթված թաղանթների կույտ է:
Եվ որոշ ռիբոսոմներ կցված են նրա վրա, ինչը ես կկոչեմ էնդոպլազմային ցանց:
Ահա մենք ունեն կցված ռիբոսոմներ: Որոշները ազատ են, որոշնեը կցված: Եկեք իմ նշանները գրեմ:
Ահա այստեղ, աջ կողմում, և մենք օգտագործում ենք տարածությունը այստեղ, այս մեծ փաթաթված թաղանթի եզրի, սա էնդոպլազմային ցանցն է: ծիծաղելի է ասել: էնդոպլազմային ցանց
Հավանաբար երաժշտական խմբի լավ անուն կլիներ
Էնդոպլազմային ցանց և այն մասերը, և այն մասերը որոնք կցված են ողորկ էնդոպլազմային ցանցին: Հավանաբար խմբի համար ավելի լավ անուն:
Ահա այստեղ, որտեղ ես կցեցի ռիբոսոմներին, ահա այս ռիբոսոմները կցված են այստեղ, սա ողորկ էնդոպլազմային ցանցն է կամ հավանաբար ողորկ ԷՑ
Ողորկ ԷՑ, ԷՑ որպես էնդոպլազմային ցանց
Եվ որտեղ, որ ռիբոսոմներ կցված են կոչվում է հարթ էնդոպլազմային ցանց
Ահա այստեղ, սա հարց էնդոպլազմային ցանցն է: Եվ ես հիմա պատրաստվում եմ ձեզ պատմել, թե ինչ է դա, բայց մենք կարող ենք շարունակել քննարկել թաղանթների մասին
Ի վերջո հասանք Գոլջիի ապարատին
Եվ ինչ է տեղի ունենում, ակնարկեցի մեր ազատ ռիբոսոմներում, ի-ՌՆԹ-ն հասնում է, վերածվում է սպիտակուցի, և սպիտակուցները հետո ուղղակի պտտվում են ցիտոպլազմայի շուրջ:
Բայց ինչ կլինի, եթե մենք ուզում ենք սպիտակուցները լինեն թաղանթում կամ բջջից դուրս:
Եվ ահա այստեղ են էնդոպլազմային ցանցն ու գոլջիի ապարատը դեր խաղում:
Որովհետև հիմա մենք ինչ կարող ենք անել, մենք ունենք ունենք ի-ՌՆԹ, որը կորիզից դուրս է գալիս, և նա կարող կպնել ռիբոսոմներին կամ կարող է թարգմանվել ռիբոսոմների կողմից ողորկ ԷՑ
Եվ ինչ է պատահում, այստեղ քո ի-ՌՆԹ գալիս է այստեղ և getting-- and I drew that arrow very small-- it's թարգմանվում է էնդոպլազմային ցանցից դուրս, բայց որպես սպիտակուց արտադրվում է, ինքը մղվում է էնդոպլազմային ցանցի մեջ
Եվ երբ ես ասում եմ էնդոպլազմային ցանցի մեջ, ես խոսում եմ տարածության մասին
Սա էնդոպլազմային ցանցի ներսն է: Եվ ահա սպիտակուցները կմղվեն ներս դեպի էնդոպլազմային ցանց
Նրանք, որոնք պիտի օգտագործվեն բջջից դուրս բջջից դուրս կամ բջջի թաղանթի համար Ահա սպիտակուցները կկանգնեն այստեղ
Ահա ինչու են ռիբոսոմները թաղանթի վրա, քանի որ նրանք կարող են թարգմանել մասնիկներ ԷՑ-ից դուրս բայց երբ սպիտակուցները արտադրվում են, ամինաթթվի շղթան վերջանում է ներսը:
Եկեք ձեզ մի քիչ զարմացնեմ, կարծում եմ դա օգտակար կլինի
Ահա եկեք գծեմ- ենթադրենք սա էնդոպլազմային ցանցի թաղանթն է և դու ունես նրան կցված ռիբոսոմներ
Ասենք սա ռիբոսոմ է էնդոպլազմային ցանցի վրա And is this is going to be the rough endoplasmic reticulum.
And what you can have is mRNA coming into one side of it. mRNA can kind of come in through here.
Սա թարգմանվում է սպիտակուցի
Բայց հետո սպիտակուցը, որպես ամինաթթվի շղթա կառուցվում է դուրս է մղվում այս թաղանթի վերջում Հիշեք, սա մեր էնդոպլազմային ցանցի թաղանթն է
Even though իՌՆԹ-ն դրսում է, որովհետև ռիբոսոմները կցված են նրան, սպիտակուցները կարող են երևալ ներսը
Հենց սպիտակուցը արտադրվում է, հավանաբար հետո պաթաթվում է գիտես, սպիտակուցը դա պարզապես պաթեթավորված սպիտակուցներ է դա կարող է անցնել ԷՑ-ի միջով
Եվ նա անցնում է դրա միջով
Անցնում է հարթ ԷՑ-ի միջով այնպես, որ հասնի Գոլջիի ապարատ
Եվ այլ տարբեր տեսակի բաներ են պատահում Սա շատ պարզվեցված է, բայց ցանկանում է պատկերացում կազմեք, թե ինչից ենք խոսում:
Եվ երբ սպիտակուցները անցնում են դեպի Գոլջիի ապարատ և պատրաստվում են բջջից դուրս գալ կամ անցնել բջջի թաղանթ, նրանք իրականում դուրս է պրծնում Գոլջիի ապարատից: այս նույն սպիտակուցը, որը գնում է գոլջիի ապարատ, հիշիր սա գոլջիի ապարատի ներսն է նկարեմ այստեղ գոլջիի ապարատի թաղանթը
Սպիտակուցը կարող է վերջանալ այստեղ Սա պարզապես ամինաթթվի երկար շղթա է
Եվ հետո դուրս կբողբոջի
Լավ եկեք ասենք, որ սա ունի այսպիսի տեսք և հավանաբար հաջորդ քայլում կունենա այսպիսի տեսք Կունենա այսպիսի տեսք
Եվ հաջորդ քայլում դու կարող ես պատկերացնեմ, կունենա այսպիսի տեսք, որտեղ իրականում ամբողջությամբ բողբոջված է
It's popped out a little of the membrane of the
Golgi body with it.
Ահա հիմա սպիտակուցը շրջապատված է իր փոքրիկ թաղանթով
Եկեք մտածենք ինչ եղավ մենք ունենք ԴՆԹ գրառված իՌՆԹ-ի իՌՆԹ գնում է ռիբոսոմ, կցվում է էնդոպլազմային ցանցին թարգմանվում է սպիտակուցի, որը անցնում է էնդոպլազմային ցանցի միջով
Սկզբում, ողորկը, որտեղ բոլոր ռիբոսոմներն են հետո հարթը
Հարթը ունի այլ ֆունկցիաներ
Օգնում է արտադրել հորմոններ և այլ ճարպային միացություններ, բայց ես չեմ մանրամասնի ուղղակի անցնում է
Կապում է գոլջիի ապարատին Հետո Գոլջիի ապարատը, սպիտակուցները դուրս են գալիս և մի փոքր մեմբրանից են վերցնում.
Եվ թաղանթով շրջապատված լինելու գաղափարը և բջջում ճանափարհորդումը, երևի սպիտակուցը այսպիսի տեսք ունի խոշորացնեմ
Երևի սպիտակուցը այստեղ է և հետո մի փոքր վերցնում է գորլջիի ապարատի թաղանթից
Սա կոչվում է բշտիկ:
Եվ ահա այստեղ, եկեք ավելացնեմ մեկ ուրիշը այստեղ Անում եմ, որպեսզի նշեմ Սա կոչվում է բշտիկ
Եվ բշտիկը իրականում հիմնական պայմանն է ամեն ինչի, փոքրիկ մասնիկներ, հիմնականում սպիտակուցներ, բջջում , որը ուղղակի պտտվում է , որոնք շրջապատված են իրենց փոքրիկ թաղանթներով
Եվ պատճառը, որ այս փոքրիկ մինի-թաղանթները օգտակար են, որ այս սպիտակուցները կարող են պտվվել ու բջջի թաղանթից դուրս գալ
Այն կարող է պտտվել բջջի այլ մասեր Կատարեմ պարզեցում
Եվ հետո այն կարող ձուլվել բջջի թաղանթը կամ կարող է օգտագործել թաղանթը, այս փոքրիկ բշտիկը, բջջից դուրս գալու համար
Դու կարող ես պատկերացնել, գիտես այս բանը- ենթադրենք բջջի արտաքին թաղանթը
Եվ կանեմ խառը պարզեցում Ես անգամ չեմ նկարում ... մասը
Սակայն ուղղակի ունենալու տեսողական տպավորում, թե ինչ տեսք կարող է ունենալ բշտիկը , փոքրիկ սպիտակուցը իր ներսը, և մոտենում է ավելի ու ավելի մոտ թաղանթին, և հետո միանում է թաղանթին քանի որ կազմված է նույն նյութից: միանում է թաղանթին, քո սպիտակուցը ներսում պատահական փոխեցի գույները
Բայց հիմա, հանկարծակի, հենց ձուլվում է թաղանթի հետ սպիտակուցը արդեն կարող հիմնական բջջից, կամ իրականում կարող է իրեն միաձուլել թաղանթին, արտաքին բջջային թաղանթին, որը կնկարեմ շատ բարակ, բայց ունի երկու շերտ
Եվ հիմա մենք կխոսենք ավելի շատ դրա մասին
Եվ ես կարող էի հավանաբար պատրաստել մի ամբողջ այս թեմայով
Ահա սրանք- մենք արդեն բավական անցել ենք ցույց են տալիս բջջի անատոմիան
Այնտեղ որոշ փոքր բաներ կան, որոնք մասին կարելի էր խոսալ կան լիզոսոմներ, որոնք գտնվում են կենդական բջջում, որոնք իրենց մեջ պարունակում են ֆերմենտներ, որոնք օգնում են մարսել այլ բաներ:
Ահա եթե լիզոսոմը կցվում է մեկ այլ բանի և ունակ է փոխել իր ֆերմենտներին, իրականում սպանել իրականում մարսում է
Բույսերում, մենք ունենք լուծվող վակուոլներ, և իրականում գրեթե նույն ֆունկցիան ունեն ինչ լիզոսոմը նրանք շատ մեծ բշտիկներ են
Փաստացի, իրականում վակուոլը ուղղակի մեծ բշտիկ է
Ուղղակի ընդհանուր տերմին է բոլոր մեծ թաղանթով շրջապտված օրգանոիդների
Վակուոլ.
Եվ նորից, ինչ է օրգանոիդը
Եկեք գրեմ այդ բառը Օրգանոիդ.
Սա ուղղակի թաղանթով շրջապտված բջջի ենթամիավոր է Օրինակ իմ լյարդը ենթամիավոր է Սալ-ի և դա օրգան է, օրգանոիդը բջջի ենթամիավոր է
Վակուոլը ուղղակի ընդհանուր պայման է թաղանթով շրջապատված օրգանոիդի, որը կուտակում է ինչ-որ բաներ մեր բջջի ներսում
Ահա լուծվող վակուոլը կլինի վակուոլ բուսական բջջում, որը կուտակում է տարբեր տեսակի ֆերմենտներ և եթե կցված է մեկ այլ բանի, կլուծվի, եթե ունակ է հանել իր սպիտակուցները մեկ այլ բաների
Հիմա, կան որոշ օրգանոիդներ, որոնք մասին խոսել ենք բջջային շնչառության և ֆոտոսինթեզի տեսանկյունից, և կմանրամասնեմ այս տեսանյութում
Բայց մենք միտքոնդրիում կոչվածներ
Միտքոնդրիան բջիջներ
Եվ նրանք ունեն ներքին և արտաքին թաղանթներ և սա այն տեղն է, որտեղ մենք արտադրում ենք էներգիա, որտեղ շաքարները վերածվում են ԱԵՖ-ի Ես բավական մանրամասնեցի այս տեսանյութում Նրան ունեն իրենց ԴՆԹ-ն, և անգամ ինքնուրույն են բազմանում, որը ստիպում է մարդկանց հավատալ, որ նրանց նախնիները եղել են անկախ պրոկարիոտ օրգանիզմենր, և ինչ-որ պահից սկսած մտածին, թե ինչու չապրել այլ օրգանիզմի մեջ և այսպես ասած ապրել սիմբիոզի մեջ
Միտոքոնդրիումները օրգաններ են, որոնց նախնինները մի ժամանակ եղել են անկախ պրոկարիոտներ
Միտոքոնդրիում Այստեղ տեղի է ունենում բջջային շնչառությունը, և մենք կմանրասնենք
Եվ հետո բուսական բջջում, մենակ--- հաստատ ոչ կենդական բջջում-- դու ունես քլորոպլաստներ որոնք ենթամիավոր են այսպես կոչված պլաստիդների, բայց ամենահայտնին քլորոպլաստներն են
Ես երևի պետք է անեի դա կանաչով
Ահա մենք ունենք քլորոպլաստ
Եվ մենք գիտենք, որ նրանք ունեն թիլակոիդնր այնտեղ Սա այն տեղն է, որտեղ ֆոտոսինթեզն է տեղի ունենում:
Դու ունես քո գրանան և ամեն ինչը
Եվ ես կմանրամասնեմ ֆոտոսինթեզի տեսանյութում, բայց լավ է իմանալ սրանք այլ օրգանոիդներ են
Եվ միտքոնդրիումի նման նրանք ունեն իրենց ԴՆԹ-ն և իրենց ռիբոսոմները
Եվ համոզմունք կա, որ նրանք անկախ պրոկարիոտներ են եղել, որոնք սիմբիոզով ապրել են ավելի մեծ էուկարիոտ բջիջներում:
Մենք հիմանկանում վերջացրել ենք բջջի կառուցվածքի թեման Այստեղ այլ բաներ կա, որ կարող ենք խոսել
Եթե մենք գործ ունենք բուսական կամ ոչկենդանական բջջի հետ մենք ունենք այսպես կոչված բջջապատ, որ տալիս է բջջին որոշակի ամրություն
Դու կարող ես նրան դիտել այդպես կամ տալ որոշակի ամրությոն .
Ահա դու ունես մասնիկներ' բջջապատ անունով, և անպայմանորեն ամուր չեն
Դու նրանց կարող ես դիտել որպես փուչիկներ, որոնք մի փոքր ավելի ամուր են
Օրինակ փայտը ունի կրկնակի բջջապատ, որը շատ ամուր է
Ահա սա բջջապատն է ոչ-կենդանական է բույսերում կազմված է ցելուլոզից, ոչ թե ցելուլիտից ժամանակին շփոթվում էի
Սա տալիս է լրացուցիչ ամրություն, որպեսզի կազմի բջջային թաղանթ
Եվ հետո տա բջջին իր իրական չափերը, դու ունես այս բաները, որոնք կոչվում են միկրոխողովակներ, կամ երբմեն ակտին թելիկներ, սրանք այն փոքրիկ խողովակներ են , որոնք անցնում են ամբողջ բջջով
Սա իրականում օգնում է բջջին ստանալ իր իրական չափսերը և իրականում կարող է մասնակցվել այն բաների մեջ, որոնք շարժվում է բջջի մեջ կամ անգամ ինքն իր շուրջը պտտվող բջջի
Եվ որպեսզի լինի ամբողջական և համոզված լինենք, որ ամեն բան արել ենք, եթե դու նայես միտոզի և մեյոզի վիդեոն , դու ունես այսպես կոչված ցենտրիոլներ
Ես ավելի մանրամասնեմ Ցենտրիոլները, որոնք կորիզից դուրս են
Երկու ցենտրիոլներ, որոնք ուղղահայաց են իրար նկատմամբ կազմում են ցենտրոսոմ, և նրանք այսպես ասած ղեկավարում են միկրոխողովակներին, երբ մենք սկսենք բաժանել բջիջը մեյոզի ու միտոզի
Ես հիմա չեմ մանրամասնի Ես շատ տեսանյութեր եմ պատրաստել այդ թեմայով
Բայց հիմա, այսքանը բավարար է իմանալ շատ լավ է, որպես առաջին նյութը բջջի կառուցվածքի մասին
Եվ մեկ տեսանյութում, մենք վերջապես ամեն բան բերեցինք մեկ տեղում այսքանը բավարար է-- ես չեմ շատ մանրամասնել ամեն բան- հիմանական մասերը բջջի
I wanted to just start by asking everyone a question: How many of you are completely comfortable with calling yourselves a leader? I've asked that question all across the country, and everywhere I ask it, no matter where, there's a huge portion of the audience that won't put up their hand.
I want to share with you the one story that is probably most responsible for that redefinition.
I went to a little school called Mount Allison University in Sackville, New Brunswick. And on my last day there, a girl came up to me and said, "I remember the first time I met you."
(Laughter) "It was awesome.
And you had a big sign promoting Shinerama," -- which is Students Fighting Cystic Fibrosis, a charity I've worked with for years -- "And you had a bucketful of lollipops. You were handing the lollipops out to people in line, and talking about Shinerama.
"Then you looked at the guy next to me, smiled, reached into your bucket, pulled out a lollipop, held it out to him and said, 'You need to give a lollipop to the beautiful woman next to you.'" She said, "I've never seen anyone get more embarrassed faster in my life.
looked at my mom and dad and said, 'Look at that! Look at that! First day away from home, and already she's taking candy from a stranger?'" (Laughter)
She gets six feet away, turns around, smiles and goes, "You should probably know this, too: I'm still dating that guy, four years later."
That was such an eye-opening, transformative moment for me, to think that maybe the biggest impact I'd ever had on anyone's life, a moment that had a woman walk up to a stranger four years later and say, "You've been an important person in my life," was a moment that I didn't even remember. How many of you guys have a lollipop moment, a moment where someone said or did something that you feel fundamentally made your life better?
Marianne Williamson said, "Our greatest fear is not that we are inadequate. [It] is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light and not our darkness that frightens us."
So we have some, some race cars racing right here and I have an interesting question to ask you. If we assume that these cars are making this turn right over here, that all of them are making this turn at a constant speed. So a constant speed constant speed of 100 kilometers per hour.
If we have 2 groups and in each group I have 4, (so that's one group of 4) (and then here is my second group of 4) we already know that we could write this as 2 times 4 which is the same thing as 4 plus 4. Notice, I have 2 fours here. I have 4 plus another 4, which is going to be equal to...
So that's one group of 2, two groups of 2, three groups of 2, four groups of 2. So we could write that 4 times 2 is equal to 8. And we could view this is the same thing as literally 4 twos.
So for the past year and a half, my team at Push Pop Press and Charlie Melcher and Melcher Media have been working on creating the first feature-length interactive book.
It's the sequel to "An Inconvenient Truth," and it explores all the solutions that will solve the climate crisis. The book starts like this. This is the cover.
Mike Matas: And so throughout the whole book,
Al Gore will walk you through and explain the photos. This photo, you can you can even see on an interactive map. Zoom into it and see where it was taken.
MM: It starts playing immediately. And while it's playing, we can pinch and peak back at the page, and the movie keeps playing.
This is one of my favorites. So this shows ...
(Laughter) (Applause) When the wind is blowing, any excess energy coming from the windmill is diverted into the battery. And as the wind starts dying down, any excess energy will be diverted back into the house -- the lights never go out.
So that's Push Pop Press' first title,
Al Gore's "Our Choice." Thank you. (Applause)
Chris Anderson: That's spectacular. Do you want to be a publisher, a technology licenser?
MM: Yeah, we're building a tool that makes it really easy for publishers right now to build this content.
So Melcher Media's team, who's on the East coast -- and we're on the West coast, building the software -- takes our tool and, every day, drags in images and text.
CA: So you want to license this software to publishers to make books as beautiful as that? (MM:
MM: Thank you. Good luck.) (Applause)
We need to add 7.056 to 605.7 to 5.67. Now when you're adding any number, you always want to make sure you line up numbers in the same place. And especially when you're dealing with decimals, the easiest way to do that is to just line up the decimals.
So you want to start off in the smallest place. So you start off here. This is the tenths, hundredths, thousandths place.
Round 9.564, or nine and five hundred sixty-four thousandths, to the nearest tenth. So let me write it a little bit larger, 9.564. And we need to round to the nearest tenth.
So this 9.564 becomes 9.6, or we can call this nine and six tenths. And then we're done!
Right now, the best estimate of when the Big Bang occurred - and once again, I don't like the term that much, 'cause it kind of implies some type of explosion, but what it really is is kind of an expansion of space - when space really started to expand from a singularity but our best estimate of when this occurred is 13.7 billion years ago, and even though we're used to dealing with numbers in the billions, especially when we talk about large amounts of money and whatnot, this is an unbelievable amount of time.
So when we looked at that depiction (this, I think, was 2 or 3 videos ago) of the observable universe,
I drew - it was a circle. It was this circle. And, when we see light coming from these remote objects, that light is getting to us right here this is where we are.
Now, what I'm going to hesitate to do, because we're talking over such large distances and such large time scales ...over which space itself is expanding, we're going to see that you cannot say that this object over here - this is not necessarily... this is NOT (I'll put it in caps.) This is NOT 13.7 billion light years away! If we're talking about smaller time scales, or, I guess, smaller distances, you could say aproximately that.
And let's just say right at that point, this [magenta] object over here emits a photon. Maybe in the microwave frequency range, and we'll see that that was the range it was emmitting in. But, it emits a photon.
And I want to make it very clear: This object is NOW 46 billion light-years away. So when we just use light to observe it, it looks like just based on light years, hey, this light's been traveling 13.7 billion years to reach us, that's our only way, kind of, with light, to think about the distance, so maybe it's 13.4 chuckle (I keep changing the decimal) but, [maybe it's]
Regardless of your opinion of how much regulation or how much intervention the government should have in markets, in capitalism generally, I think it's interesting to take a look at the various cycles that have happened in the United States, both from an economic point of view and also from a regulatory point of view. If we start in the late 1800s, in the late 1800s so we've had the Civil War, we've had Reconstruction.
If you inflation-adjust so some accounts will say he had 1.5 billion dollars. You might say, "Wait, I know of people "who have more than 1.5 billion dollars."
You have people like JP Morgan. Although is net worth also huge, huge amount, but where his power was really .... Since he was in control of the financial world at that time, his financial power was tremendous.
So you can decide where you will, but the reality is that these people were hugely, hugely, hugely wealthy, hugely powerful. Now you fast forward to the early 1900s and you start having a little bit of a backlash against these ... I guess the system in which these type of people can thrive.
 We're on problem 21.
Stan's solution to an equation is shown below. All right, and I haven't looked at it yet, but let's just see what they ask us. Which statement about Stan's solution is true?
If we say x is positive, then definitely. You know, minus 3 is less than positive 3. So the statement is true for positive numbers.
And D. The statement is true for negative numbers. No, it's not.
Problem 23. What is the y-intercept of the graph? OK, let me see.
So if you were to graph this line, not that I'm going to-- the y-intercept is when it intersects the y-axis. So it's that point there. It's what's this y-coordinate.
Well the x-coordinate, it's when x is equal to 0. So it's going to be 0 comma some y-intercept. So the easiest thing to do is say when x is equal to 0, what is y?
So when x is equal to 0, this 4 times 0 is equal to 0. So that just becomes 0. So you get 2y is equal to 12. y is equal to 6, and that's choice C.
That's what the y-intercept is. Next problem. OK, they've drawn us a graph.
And now we just have to figure out the slope. And the slope is just change in y for a given change in x. So if we say change in y for a given change in x is equal to-- let's see.
So change in y is 1 when the change in x is 2. And you could say when you increase x by 4-- I'm going four spots-- I increase y by 2.
So you could have done that. You could have said change in y over change in x is 2/4, which is also equal to 1/2. But either way, we now know the slope.
So our choices are y is greater than or equal to 1/2 x minus 1 or y is less than or equal to 1/2 x minus 1. Now think about for any given x. Let's say when x is equal to 2.
The equation of this inequality or this area is y is greater than 1/2 x minus 1.
And just a very easy way to eyeball it is OK, they're including the line, so I'm going to have this equal then-- it's going to either be greater than or equal to or less than or equal to, and since it's the area above the line it's going to be greater than or equal to.
And that is choice D. Next problem, problem 25.
This is another one where I think it makes sense to copy and paste it. It's a big one.
OK. Which best represents the graph of y id equal to 2x minus 2.
So the slope is 2. Its positive 2 and its y-intercept is minus 2.
So the y-intercept is easy to eyeball. Here the y-intercept is minus 2. That's right.
Well in choice A when I go to the right by 2, I go up by 4. So change in y over change in x. I go up by 4, when I go up in x by 2.
So this has a positive slope of 2, so that's choice A.
But just for seeing why choice C doesn't work or figuring out the slope, think about it this way. Let me start at a random point here. If I increase x value by 2, what's happening to my y value?
Is it increasing by 2 or is it decreasing by 2? Well it's decreasing. Well it's decreasing by 4.
What happened to y. It went down 4. So here the slope is minus 2.
You can kind of eyeball it because it's going from the top left to the bottom right, so it's going to be a negative number.
But the easiest way I always do is to draw these arrows and say, OK, when I increase x, y is decreasing.
So that's going to be a negative slope. Let's do it.
So the answer was A. Next problem. OK, so they're giving us another one of these where they shaded a graph.
When x increases by 1, what happens to y? y is going down by 3.
So the y-intercept is equal to 2. We figured that out. b is equal to 2.
The slope is equal to change in y over change in x.
When x increases by 1, the slope-- sorry.
The change in y is minus 3.
It goes down by 3.
So the slope is equal to minus 3. So the equation of this line is y is equal to minus 3x plus 2. mx plus b. And if I look at the choices, already it looks a little bit different than that, but we'll get to that.
If we pick any x, say when x is equal to 2, then according to this equation, according to this line, y would be equal to minus 4.
Now, are we including the y's that are greater than that value as well or are we including the y's that are
less than that value?
Well, we're including the ones that are less than that point for a given x.
So the shaded region is y is less than or equal to minus 3x plus 2.
And you can eyeball this.
You can kind of say, oh, this is below the graph, so it's
less than or equal.
And that equal was because they shaded in the line.
If it was a dotted line it would just be less than.
Once again, this isn't the exact format that they have here.
They put all the x's and the y's on the same side, and we can do that.
Let's just add 3x to both sides of this equation and you get 3x plus y is less than or equal to.
When you add 3x on the right-hand side that just becomes 0.
So less than or equal to 2.
And that is 3x plus y is less than or equal to positive 2.
And that is choice A.
And I'm all out of time, see you in the next video.

What I want to do in this video is think about the difference between a line segment (a line segment) a line (a line), and a ray (and a ray). And this is kind of the pure geometrical versions of these, of these, things. And so a line segment is actually probably what most of us associate with a line in our everyday lives.
We are asked to add the complex number 5 + 2i to the other complex number 3 - 7i and as we'll see when we are adding complex numbers you can only add the real parts to each other and you can only add the imaginary parts to each other. So let's add the real parts: so we have a 5 plus a 3 so we have a 5 plus a 3 And then the imaginary parts: we have 2i so plus 2i and then we have a -7i or we're adding or we're subtracting 7i
Now, I want to start with a question: When was the last time you were called "childish"? For kids like me, being called childish can be a frequent occurrence.
Now, adults seem to have a prevalently restrictive attitude towards kids, from every "Don't do that, don't do this" in the school handbook, to restrictions on school Internet use.
As history points out, regimes become oppressive when they're fearful about keeping control. And although adults may not be quite at the level of totalitarian regimes, kids have no or very little say in making the rules, when really, the attitude should be reciprocal, meaning that the adult population should learn and take into account the wishes of the younger population. Now, what's even worse than restriction, is that adults often underestimate kids' abilities.
"The Wheels on the Bus Go Round and Round." Well, we heard that one too, but "Pioneer Germ Fighters" totally rules. (Laughter)
This is really a two-hour presentation I give to high school students, cut down to three minutes. And it all started one day on a plane, on my way to TED, seven years ago. And in the seat next to me was a high school student, a teenager, and she came from a really poor family.
So here we are, seven years, 500 interviews later, and I'm going to tell you what really leads to success and makes TEDsters tick. And the first thing is passion.
Freeman Thomas says, "I'm driven by my passion."
TEDsters do it for love; they don't do it for money.
Carol Coletta says, "I would pay someone to do what I do." And the interesting thing is: if you do it for love, the money comes anyway.
Rupert Murdoch said to me, "It's all hard work. Nothing comes easily. But I have a lot of fun."
Did he say fun? Rupert? Yes!
(Laughter) TEDsters do have fun working. And they work hard.
Alex Garden says, "To be successful, put your nose down in something and get damn good at it." There's no magic; it's practice, practice, practice. And it's focus.
Norman Jewison said to me,
"I think it all has to do with focusing yourself on one thing."
David Gallo says, "Push yourself. Physically, mentally, you've got to push, push, push." You've got to push through shyness and self-doubt.
Goldie Hawn says, "I always had self-doubts. I wasn't good enough; I wasn't smart enough. I didn't think I'd make it."
Frank Gehry said to me,
"My mother pushed me." (Laughter)
Serve! Sherwin Nuland says, "It was a privilege to serve as a doctor." A lot of kids want to be millionaires.
The first thing I say is: "OK, well you can't serve yourself; you've got to serve others something of value. Because that's the way people really get rich."
Joe Kraus says, "Persistence is the number one reason for our success." You've got to persist through failure.
 Let's think a little bit about two terms that you'll see throughout your geometry, and really, mathematical career. One is the idea of things being perpendicular.
Actually I'm misspelling it-- perpendicular lines, and the idea of parallel lines. So perpendicular lines are two lines that intersect at a right angle. So what am I talking about?
Right here I have graphed part of the graph of y is equal to 1/x. And what I'm curious about is the area under this curve and above the x-axis between x equals 1 and infinity. So I want to figure out this area right over here.
So this boils down to the limit as n approaches infinity of the natural log of n. Now this is interesting. Natural log function just keeps getting
The limit as n approaches infinity of the natural log of n is just equal to infinity. So here we do not have a finite area. This is an infinite.

Let's figure out what eleven and twelve sixteenths minus five in eight sixteenths is. We might have to simplify it down to lowest terms. So the way I like to do these is the kind of separate out the whole number part of the mixed numbers from the fractional part.
So it's going to be minus five, minus five, negative one times five.
The negative one times positive eight sixteenth so it's going to be minus, minus eight over sixteen.
Minus eight over sixteen. And then I like to do the whole number part separately and the fractional part separately. So let's do the whole number parts.
Will do that part that's a whole number part and then we have plus plus twelve sixteenth - let me do this in pink maybe - plus twelve sixteenth minus eight sixteenth minus eight over sixteen.
And eleven minus five is six. And I have six plus - and the denominators are same here - so we're gonna get something over sixteen and twelve minus eight is four. So this is the same thing as six plus four over sixteen, which is the same thing as writing is a mixed number six and four sixteenths.
HTML5 can be used to create all sorts of engaging and dynamic applications. It's brought about an explosion of new browser features like rich graphics, device access and advance network connectivity.
Let's think about how or what 1/2 times 5 represents. So one way to think about it is that this could be five 1/2's added together. So you could view this as 1/2 plus 1/2 plus 1/2 plus 1/2 plus 1/2, which is the same thing as 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1, over 2, which is equal to 5/2.
As we enter into the 1917 the United States has been able to maintain its neutrality in WWl, in fact President Wilson has just won a reelection based on the platform that he kept us out of war and to a large degree he was able to keep the US out of war because the German Empire had pulled back from its unrestricted submarine warfare after the sinking of the Lusitania and how angered America had gotten, they said: "Okay, we're not gonna attack passenger vessels anymore we're only gonna attack things that are definitely British non-passenger vessels." But as we go into January of 1917 the British blockade on the Central Powers was having its effect and the Central Powers were getting desperate, in particular Germany so they were eager to essentially... uh... do the same to the British once again go with the unrestricted submarine warfare but the Germans knew that if they were to go back to this that it's likely that the US would enter the war on the side of the Allies so knowing that was likely to happen they said: "well how could we slow the US down?" and the thinking was "well, we could somehow enlist the help of Mexico" which at the time was not on the best terms with the US and so Arthur Zimmermann...
Arthur Zimmermann who was the German Foreign Secretary the equivalent of the United States Secretary of State or the foreign minister Arthur Zimmermann sends an encoded telegram to... the Mexicans and its encoded especially because it has to go over lines that are controlled by the Americans. And in it, he actually proposes an alliance to slow the Americans down so this is what he wrote... so this is the encoded telegram and then it was actually intercepted and decoded by British intelligence and then shared with the Americans and that was also then made public... to the American public.
You will hear me use the word abstract a lot so i thought i would actually give you an attempt at a definition, or maybe even more important an intuition of what abstract means and abstract can be an adjective you can have an abstract idea you can have abstract art or it can be a verb you can abstract something abstract the idea from some other idea and you can even have it as a noun you can have an abstract and it tends to, if you use it as a noun the one I tend to associate is the abstract of research paper, which is kind of, distills the essence of the research paper, which is kind of a summary of that paper and the one thing you are going to see regardless of how you what context you use the word abstract there's this kind of notion taking the essence of a real world object whether you use it as a noun, adjective, or a verb so over here we have our real world we have our real world and then over here you have your world of you have ideas and concepts and the general idea behind the abstraction or abstracting something is that you're taking it away from the particular concrete real world and you're going more into the direction of ideas and concepts and probably for me, one of the most tangible ways of thinking about abstraction, which is kind of a contradiction in itself to think of abstraction in a tangible way is things like geometric shapes so if i were to tell you to find me some cubes you might point to a borg vessel right over there a borg vessel you might point to a pair of dice
let me draw a pair of dice if you were looking for cubes so you might point to a pair of dice that looks something like that you might point to a Rubik's cube anything you might find there might be a building that looks like a cube it might be a building that looks like a cube or maybe there is a box in your house that is a cube but in your mind you have a general idea of what a cube is like i know a cube when i see one and a general idea is distilling the concept the idea of what a cube is and all of these ideas are very different this is some plastic thing i could hold in my hand these are these white things they aren't even geometrically close to being perfect they have these little divets on the side right over there this is a large borg vessel that you know that doesn't exist yet is a fictional thing that they all have this cubeness to them one of the fun things about geometry so really distill the essence of these real world shapes and we do have this definition in geometry which is an object like this where every side has the exact same length so this is length one and that would be length one that would be length one it doesn't have to be whatever the length of this side is and this dimension then this dimension would be that length and then that dimension is going to be that length and i'm not giving you the rigorous definition but i'm just trying to highlight that there is pure idea of what a cube is of what a cube is and the real world, there is nothing that is actually a perfect cube if you were to get really really close to the die if you were to measure exactly their measurements they won't be exactly the same measurement but the abstract idea is completely the same length as this and this and this and all of the edges are going to have the exact same length so this is going from the concrete the specific from the real world if you consider the 24th or the 25th century, the real world to going to the idea behind it, the general idea and you probably also heard the word abstract in terms of art, like abstract art so this is abstract art and it is the same general idea so if you to look it up in the dictionary you're going to find 20 definitions of the word abstract but it's all, essentially trying to say the same thing abstract art is art that is not focused on trying to paint reality the exact way reality exists if you look at kind of lot of Renaissance art they are skilled at painting figures exactly how they look in the real world but the abstract artist sometimes they're not even trying to represent anything from the real world they are trying to represent a raw idea or a raw expression of color and form and texture and this is a Jackson Pollock painting right over here and i printed out so many things wrong taken by our own Steven Zucker, our art historian and you can see that it's not clear
Jackson Pollock is not trying to paint a you know, a dog or horse or anything like that he is painting something that is devoid completely independent of anything that we actually see in physical reality and the word, abstraction, you know, it doesn't just apply on just a pure geometry and art it applies to almost everything we do on a daily basis when we even talk about things when we even use words or use symbols we are essentially abstracting away we're abstracting the essence of something that actually exists in physical reality so if i use the word dog it is a set of symbols that represent something in our mind that we associate with dog we have in our minds kind of the quality of what a dog actually is you know, it has four legs and floppy ears and you enjoy petting it and they're man's or i guess people's best friend you imagine this thing called a dog and it has the essence of dog and when you actually look at dogs in the real world they look very very different type of animals like when you look at a great dane or kind of a super small poodle But we recognize there is an essence of those particulars that we can abstract away and say this is a dog and we abstract it even more by representing these letter symbols that tend to conjure up this image even when we write something as simple as a number so if i write the number five we use it so frequently that to us a number 5 seems kind of like a concrete thing but it 's so abstract it's just a quantity of things i can symbolize like that i could have symbolized 5 like that i could have symbolized 5 in roman numerals like that i could symbolize it like that and in all of these cases they are it is the idea of a quantity of five things five, you know, you could say point me to a five and someone could draw or point you to something like that but they are still pointing you to the symbol of five but it's still an very abstract idea so hopefully this gives you an appreciation for what abstract means as you can tell, you know it's kind of a, for lack of a better word it's kind of an abstract idea not to be too cute about that
You buy a truck for $60,000 to start a shipping business. The truck has a useful life of 3 years. You then have to buy another truck.
Let's try to learn a thing or two about ratios. So ratios are just expressions that compare quantities. So that might just be a fancy way-- let me just --of saying something that you may or may not understand.
If I wanted to talk about the number of dogs, this is the number of dogs, that's the number of dogs, or that's the number of dogs. I'm just-- These are all just expressions that are comparing two quantities. Now, I just said I have ten horses for every five dogs.
I'm looking for the ratio of dogs to horses, I switch the numbers. So dogs-- For every five dogs, I have ten horses. Or if I divide both of these by five, for every one dog, I have five horses.
And let's say that I have sixty strawberries. Now what is the ratio of apples to oranges to strawberries?
I could write it like this. I could write what is the ratio of-- I'll write it like this --apples:oranges:strawberries?
Well I can start off by literally saying, well for sixty strawberries-- for every sixty strawberries, I have forty oranges and I have twenty apples.
You could say the ratio of apples to oranges to strawberries are twenty:forty-- Sorry. twenty:forty:sixty. And that wouldn't be wrong. But we saw before, we could put into reduced form.
What if it went the other way? What if I told you a ratio? What if I said the ratio of boys to girls in a classroom is-- Let's say the ratio of boys to girls is two / three.
The ratio of boys to girls is equal to two:three.
Hate to be so stereotypical, but it doesn't hurt. two:three. The ratio of boys to girls is two:three. So this stands for every three girls, there's two boys.
Now why is this statement helpful? Well how many groups of five students do I have? I have forty students in my class right there, right?
So each group is going to have three girls. So how many girls do I have? I have eight groups, each of them have three girls.
Round 1,585 to the nearest ten. Let me rewrite the number. 1,585 to the nearest ten.
Danny: Danny O'Neill with The Roasterie. I was born and raised in a small town in Iowa.
"Okay, you're going to Costa Rica to live for a year." I went to high school and played basketball with my friends down there. Later in the year, I went coffee picking, and I didn't drink coffee at the time, but we were up in the mountains, and it was just, it was idyilic.
Best coffee, best roasted, fast as possible. I was scared to death. I had $17,000 and started in my basement.
Let's say that I've got two Chuck Norrises (or maybe it's Chuck Norri) and to that I am going to add another three Chuck Norrises So I'm going to add another three Chuck Norrises And this might seem a little bit obvious but how many Chuck Norrises do I now have?
How many X's do I have?
Well, once again, 2 X's that's 2 times X and you can view it as an X plus an X.
We don't know what the value of X is but whatever that value is we can add it to itself And then three X's are going to be that value I'll do it in that same green colour
If have seven Y's and to that I add two Y's I'm going to have nine Y's If I have seven of something and I have two of something, I now have nine of that something
You add the X's ... you get that right over there So hopefully that makes a little sense Actually, I'll throw out one more idea
A few years ago, my eyes were opened to the dark side of the construction industry. In 2006, young Qatari students took me to go and see the migrant worker camps. And since then I've followed the unfolding issue of worker rights.
Groups like Buildsafe UAE have emerged, but the numbers are simply overwhelming. In August 2008, UAE public officials noted that 40 percent of the country's 1,098 labor camps had violated minimum health and fire safety regulations.
A function, f(x), is plotted below. Highlight an interval where f(x) is less than 0. So f(x), which is really being plotted on the vertical axis right over here -- x is the horizontal axis. f(x) being less than zero really means that the graph is below the x axis.
John Singleton Copley, A Boy with a Flying Squirrel (Henry Pelham), 1765 So, imagine wanting to be an artist, but you live in a city where there are virtually no artists, no art schools, no art museums, no galleries and no one who wants to buy serious paintings. This is precisely the situation John Singleton Copley found himself in, in Boston the 1760's.
light catching and on the near side you have that area in shadow that just plays beautifully alternating against itself so while this is a portrait of Copley's half brother , its also a kind of demonstration piece. By 1765 when Copley painted this he was a well regarded professional potrait painter in Boston but he wanted to be more.
Copley also knew that portrait painting was actually the bottom of a hierarchy of subjects created by the academies in Europe, the highest paintings being paintings of religion and mythology and history, portraiture and still life being the lowest. But it was portraits that people wanted in new American cities
Right, so the merchant class in boston, the wealthy elite had begun to really recognize the value of portraying themselves But Copley wanted to push beyond that. Copley knew that Europe painting was more and so this painting was actually made, as you said as a demonstration piece to see if he could hold his own with the European academies
So he had this packed up in someone's luggage who was going off to London and there it was pretty well received by Benjamin West, an American painter who was living in London and was pretty succesfull and by sir Joshua Reynolds who was president of the Royal Academy in England so the first thing we might notice is that we are not looking at the front of the figures face, we are looking at him from the side so we think that Copley did this he wanted to show that he could paint not just portraits but also genre paintings where scenes of everyday life i think copley was also really showing off what he could do with fore shortening which is really a difficult thing to do if you look at the sitters right hand its just perfectly fore shortened as is the corner of the table. when this painting goes to England, Sir Joshua Reynold does praise it but he says , before too long he better come to London and get some real training here before your manner and taste are corrupted or fixed by working in this little way in Boston which i think, makes sense because the way that England ruled as this important artistic presence
Copley felt that the situation in Boston was so inhospitable that he said artists retreated like shoemakers. So, Copley is clearly aware of the limitations of Boston, limitations of the colonies He's aware that portraiture which he does is a low form of art but he's also, i think in a way, very practical. he knows that this is what people want, and he's able to do it masterfully and beautifully but there is a lingering sense that he is not painting the grand history, and religious and mythological paintings of the European tradition and maybe cant compete on that level.
Philip: I'm Philip Rosedale. I'm the founder and now the chairman of SecondLife.
Well, second life is kind of like the world's biggest LEGO kit in a way.
It's a virtual world, 3-dimensional world in which everything is built by the people who come there, so it's kind of a blank canvas in which you can build anything. The other thing that's fascinating about it as a virtual world is that we go there, that people are present there as avatars, these digital projections of ourselves into that world. The beginning of it was my belief that it would be this amazing kind of visual playground with all this architecture and all these things built by people, and that was true to an even greater extent than I had imagined.
One of the obstacles we had to overcome with SecondLife was simply waiting and not spending too much money while we waited. I had been passionate about building a virtual world
like SecondLife, literally since the end of high school, but I didn't believe until 1999 that the technology was in place to enable a business to be built around a virtual world, and so in that time in between, I actually told all my friends, "I've got to wait." I cannot do this yet.
so now we have a very very very interesting problem on the left hand side of the scale I have two different types of unknown masses one of these X masses and we know that they have the same identical mass, we call that identical each of them having a mass of X But then we have this other blue thing and that has a mass of Y, which isn't necessarily going to be the same as the mass of X. We have two of these X's and a Y.It seems like the total mass or it definitely is the case, their total mass balance it out to these 8 kg right over here.
Well the simple answer is just with this information here, there's actually very little. You might say that "Oh well, let me take the Y from both sides" You might take this Y block up. But if you take this Y block up you have to take away Y from this side and you don't know what Y is.
Same thing with the X's, you actually don't have enough information. Y depends on what X is,and X depends on what Y is. Lucky for us however,we do have some more of these blocks laying around.
Well an X and a Y we know has a mass of 5. So we can subtract 5 from the right hand side. And the only way I'm gonna be able to do this is because of the information that we got from the second scale.
And you'll see that 2Xs are gonna be 6kg plus my Y is 2kg that will balance 8kg. And 3 plus 2 was equal to 5.
I was one of the only kids in college who had a reason to go to the P.O. box at the end of the day, and that was mainly because my mother has never believed in email, in Facebook, in texting or cell phones in general. And so while other kids were BBM-ing their parents, I was literally waiting by the mailbox to get a letter from home to see how the weekend had gone, which was a little frustrating when Grandma was in the hospital, but I was just looking for some sort of scribble, some unkempt cursive from my mother.
Overnight, my inbox morphed into this harbor of heartbreak -- a single mother in Sacramento, a girl being bullied in rural Kansas, all asking me, a 22-year-old girl who barely even knew her own coffee order, to write them a love letter and give them a reason to wait by the mailbox.
Well, today I fuel a global organization that is fueled by those trips to the mailbox, fueled by the ways in which we can harness social media like never before to write and mail strangers letters when they need them most, but most of all, fueled by crates of mail like this one, my trusty mail crate, filled with the scriptings of ordinary people, strangers writing letters to other strangers not because they're ever going to meet and laugh over a cup of coffee, but because they have found one another by way of letter-writing. But, you know, the thing that always gets me about these letters is that most of them have been written by people that have never known themselves loved on a piece of paper.
"Well, why don't you use the Internet?" And I thought, "Well, sir, I am not a strategist, nor am I specialist. I am merely a storyteller."
And so I could tell you about a woman whose husband has just come home from Afghanistan, and she is having a hard time unearthing this thing called conversation, and so she tucks love letters throughout the house as a way to say, "Come back to me. Find me when you can."
Or a girl who decides that she is going to leave love letters around her campus in Dubuque, Iowa, only to find her efforts ripple-effected the next day when she walks out onto the quad and finds love letters hanging from the trees, tucked in the bushes and the benches. Or the man who decides that he is going to take his life, uses Facebook as a way to say goodbye to friends and family.
Well, tonight he sleeps safely with a stack of letters just like this one tucked beneath his pillow, scripted by strangers who were there for him when. These are the kinds of stories that convinced me that letter-writing will never again need to flip back her hair and talk about efficiency, because she is an art form now, all the parts of her, the signing, the scripting, the mailing, the doodles in the margins. The mere fact that somebody would even just sit down, pull out a piece of paper and think about someone the whole way through, with an intention that is so much harder to unearth when the browser is up and the iPhone is pinging and we've got six conversations rolling in at once, that is an art form that does not fall down to the Goliath of "get faster," no matter how many social networks we might join.
In half a century of trying to help prevent wars, there's one question that never leaves me: How do we deal with extreme violence without using force in return? When you're faced with brutality, whether it's a child facing a bully on a playground or domestic violence -- or, on the streets of Syria today, facing tanks and shrapnel, what's the most effective thing to do?
"Okay, I see it's serious. You're much too young to help. You need training.
And my heroine here -- like Satish's -- is Aung San Suu Kyi in Burma. She was leading a group of students on a protest in the streets of Rangoon. They came around a corner faced with a row of machine guns.
And no one got killed. So that's what the mastery of fear can do -- not only faced with machine guns, but if you meet a knife fight in the street. But we have to practice.
It's people joining up with people, as Bundy just said, miles away to bring about change.
And Peace Direct spotted quite early on that local people in areas of very hot conflict know what to do. They know best what to do. So Peace Direct gets behind them to do that.
Up to now their counter-terrorism policy has been to kill insurgents at almost any cost, and if civilians get in the way, that's written as "collateral damage." And this is so infuriating and humiliating for the population of Afghanistan, that it makes the recruitment for al-Qaeda very easy, when people are so disgusted by, for example, the burning of the Koran. So the training of the troops has to change.
A lot of it is due to a book written by an 80-year-old man in Boston, Gene Sharp. He wrote a book called "From Dictatorship to Democracy" with 81 methodologies for non-violent resistance. And it's been translated into 26 languages.

Male voice: We're looking at François Boucher's "De Marcido Pompadour"
Female voice: But I have, before we go into, to say... ...that I don't really like Rococo paintings but I really like this one. There's something really... beautiful about it.
So let's talk about those things for just a moment because they really do catch the eye.
They have volume and structure and you can feel the weight and the stiffness of the fabric and the proof is the opposite of that.
Female voice: That's true, I haven't thought of that.
Male voice: It's almost as we're looking at Japanese cartoons... what are those called?
Female voice:
It's certainly not about her personality and who she was, and her humanity, and then he...
Male voice: No, it's about her persona, right?
Female voice: Yes, her persona. And, that's to me, that's what the whole painting is about.
Female voice: In regard it's the king's lover, in that way?
Male voice: Yeah, and also just the sense of proximity.
Female voice: That's true, we're very close to her.
Male voice: Yeah, we feel as we could've reach out.
Female voice: We're her best friend and she's about to share - ...an intimate secret.
Male voice: But then our eyes rise up across her wrist over the portrait of her lover, across her breast, up to her neck, and then finally, we get to her face which seems, sort of, almost remote.
The first thing I'd noticed was all of those accessories of artifice and then I've looked at her face, you know, I've read the label...
The sense of clarity with which the artifice as you put it, is painted against the softness and the indeterminacy of her individuality ...is, I think, clearest in the colour.

Is the proportion true or false that 3/12 or 3:12 is equal to 5/35 or 5:35? Now to figure this out, we just have to figure out whether these are equivalent fractions, and the easiest way to do that, is to put both of them in simplified form, and see if we get the same answer. So let's try with 3/12 first.
In the last video, using the accrual basis for accounting we had $200 of income in month 2, but over that same month, we saw that we went from having $100 in cash, to having negative $100 in cash, so we actually lost $200 in cash.
So how can we reconcile the fact that it looks like we made $200 in income, but we lost $200 in cash? And that reconciliation is going to be done with the cash flow statement. So most cash flow statements, they'll start so I'm going to do a cash flow statement right over here
Welcome back. I'm now going to do a bunch of projectile motion problems, and this is because I think you learn more just seeing someone do it, and thinking out loud, than all the formulas. I have a strange notion that I might have done more harm than good by confusing you with a lot of what I did in the last couple of videos, so hopefully I can undo any damage if I have done any, or even better-- hopefully, you did
Newton's first law tells us that an object at rest will stay at rest and an object with a constant velocity will keep having that constant velocity unless it is affected by some type of net force. Or you actually could say that something with constant velocity will stay having a constant velocity unless affected by a net force. This takes into consideration the situation where an object is at rest.
That's what Newton's second law gives us.
So Newton's Second Law of Motion. This one is maybe the most famous. (They're all kind of famous.
Acceleration is a vector quantity and Force is a vector quantity It tells us...If you apply a force, it might change the constant velocity but how does it change that constant velocity? Say I have a brick floating in space.
But if you have a net force applied to one side of this object then you would have a net acceleration going in the same direction and what Newton's second law of motion tells us is that the acceleration will be proportional to the force applied or the force applied is proportional to that acceleration. and the constant to proportionality...or to figure out what you multiply the acceleration by to get the force, or what to divide the force by to get the acceleration... ...is called mass. that is an object's mass DO NOT CONFUSE MASS WlTH WElGHT! (And I'll make a whole video on the difference between mass and weight)
We'll just use F=m*a You have, on the left hand side, 10 Newtons... or 10 kg*m/(s^2) and that is going to be equal to the mass... which is 2 kg... times the acceleration and then to solve for the acceleration, you just divide both sides by 2 kg So let's divide the left by 2 kg and let's divide the right by 2 kg.
Then I have, 20 Newtons (I'll actually work it out) then I'll have 20 kg*m/(s^2)... ...is equal to 2 kg times the acceleration divide both sides by 2 kg and what do we get? it cancels out...20 divided by 2 is 10...kilograms cancels with kilograms So then we have... the acceleration, in this situation, is equal to 10 m/(s^2) So when we double the force...we went from 10 Newtons to 20 Newtons...the acceleration doubled!
I now want to turn my attention from all of the craziness that's happening in Europe and go halfway around the world to one of France's colonies in the Caribbean, that's Saint-Domingue. And I know I'm butchering all of the pronunciations. But Saint-Domingue, and its modern name is Haiti,
Plants are freaking great because they have this magical wizard power that allows them to take carbon dioxide out of the air and convert it into wonderful, fresh, pure oxygen for us to breathe.
Paula Deen can't do that, and she makes fried egg bacon doughnut burgers.
I'm telling you, this is surprisingly good. This is a different kind of magic, but part of this is plants. Everything in it, in fact everything that is in this [McDonalds], in fact, everything you have ever eaten in your life is either made from plants or made from something that ate plants.
These plants were lycophytes, which are still around today and which reproduce through making a bunch of spores, shedding them, saying a couple of Hail Marys, and hoping for the best. Some of these lycophytes went on to evolve into scale trees, which are now extinct, but huge, swampy forests of them used to cover the earth. Some people call these scale tree forests coal forest because there were so many of them, they were so dense and they covered the whole earth, that they eventually fossilized into giant seams of coal, which are very important to our lifestyles today.
Anyway, angiosperms, or plants that used flowers to reproduce, didn't develop until the end of the Cretaceous Period, about 65 million years ago, just as the dinosaurs were dying out.
Which makes you wonder if, in fact, the first angiosperms assassinated all the dinosaurs. I'm not saying that's definitely what happened. I'm just, it's a little bit suspicious.
They're called eukaryotic cells, which means they have a good kernel, and that kernel is the nucleus. Not "nuculus". The nucleus can be found in all sorts of cells: animal cells, plant cells, algae cells.
Eukaryotic cells are way more advanced than prokaryotic cells. We have the eukaryotic cell and we have the prokaryotic cell.
Prokaryotic basically means before the kernel, pro-kernel.
Then we have the eukaryotic, which means good kernel.
The prokaryotes include your bacteria and your archea, which you've probably met before in your lifetime. Every time you've had strep throat, for example. Or if you've ever been in a hot spring, or an oil well or something, they're everywhere: they cover the planet; they cover you.
It's important to keep those places divided up. Eukaryotic cells also have these little stuff-doing factories called organelles, because we decided that we'd name everything something weird.
But organelles, and they're suspended in cytoplasm, continuing with the really esoteric terminology that you're going to have to know.
Cytoplasm is mostly just water, but it's some other stuff, too. Well, basically, if you want to know about the structure of the eukaryotic cell, you should watch my video on animal cells, which let's just link to it right here. Plant and animal cells are very similar environments.
This cell wall of plants is mainly made out of cellulose and lignin, which are two really tough compounds. Cellulose is by far the most common and easy to find complex carbohydrate in nature, though if you were to include simple carbohydrates as well, glucose would win that one. This is because, fascinating fact, cellulose is in fact just a chain of glucose molecules.
But you know what's a real pain in the ass to digest? Cellulose. Plants weren't born yesterday.
Cellulose is a far more complex structure than you'll generally find in a prokaryotic cell, and it's also one of the main things that differentiates a plant cell from an animal cell. Animals do not have this rigid cell wall. They have a flexible membrane that frees them up to move around and eat plants and stuff.
Which is why trees aren't squishy, and they don't giggle when you poke them. The combination of lignin and cellulose is what makes trees, for example, able to grow really, really freaking tall. Both of these compounds are extremely strong and resistant to deterioration.
We know how they do that. They do it with photosynthesis. Another thing that plant cells have that animal cells just don't have are plastids, the organelles that plants use to make and store compounds that they need.
Express d times 4d to the fourth to the one half power as a radical expression. So the key thing to realise here is that if I take anything to the one half power by definition, this is the same thing as taking the principle root of that anything.
So let's just apply that here we have 4d to the fourth raised to the one half power. So this part, right over here, let me do it in two different colours, so I have d right over there, and the I have 4d to the fourth raised to the one half power which by definition is the principle root, of 4d to the fourth and we explore other videos while this all works out well with exponent properties. Now we know how to simplify this right here.
We are looking for the principle root of this is the same thing, this is the same thing as d times the principle root of 4 times the principle root of d to the fourth, times the principle root of d to the fourth
The principle root of four, principle root of four is 2, and we have that d out front. And the principle root of d to the 4th power is the I should do it as a positive square root of d to the four
 In this video I want to do a bunch of examples of factoring a second degree polynomial, which is often called a quadratic. Sometimes a quadratic polynomial, or just a quadratic itself, or quadratic expression, but all it means is a second degree polynomial.
So what could a and b be? Let's think about the factors of 50. It could be 1 times 50.
Let's think a little bit about what happened in the last video. I'll review again these different notions of money supply. And then let's talk about whether it's fair for people to think that they really have the money that they have
In M0 we said -- we'll call this our narrowest definition. And this is literally, how much gold is there in the system. Or how much stuff is there in the system that could be immediately used for conducting a transaction.
Identify 15 eights, or 15 over 8, as a proper or an improper fraction. or an improper fraction. So this is actually just a good review of proper and improper fractions. And there's a pretty easy way to identify them.
So 15 is greater than or equal to 8, so we are dealing with an improper fraction.
What is the perimeter of the shape? Each square in the grid is a one by one centimeter square. So, all we have to do is add up the lengths of these blue segments, right over here.
- In the last video, we saw a reality where the currency between, or the exchange rate between, the Yuan and the dollar started off at 10 to 1. And at that exchange rate, China was shipping more goods-- in terms of whether you measure it in dollars or
Let me do this in a new color. - And what they do, they can actually just print money. So we had this scenario that I had outlined in the last two videos where we had this imbalance.
John: Hi I'm John Green. This is Crash Course world history and today we're going to discuss the series of events that made it possible for you to watch Crash Course.
The most successful steam engine was built by Thomas, they didn't name anything after me, Newcomen, to clear water out of mines, and because water was cleared out of those mines, there was more coal to power more steam engines, which eventually led to the fancying up of the Newcomen steam engine by James, I've got a unit of power and a University named after me, Watt, whose engine made possible not only railroads and steamboats, but also ever more efficient cotton mills. For the first time, chemicals other than stale urine, I wish I was kidding, were being used to bleach the cloth that people wore. The first of which was sulfuric acid, which was created in large quantities only thanks to lead wine chambers, which would have been impossible without lead production rising dramatically right around 1750 in Britain thanks to lead boundaries powered by coal.
A process that would eventually culminate in $18 Crash Course mongol shirts available now at DFTBA.com. Thanks thought bubble for that shameless promotion of our beautiful high quality t-shirts available now at DFTBA.com. So the problem here is that with industrialization being so deeply interconnected, it's really difficult to figure out why it happened in Europe, especially Britain.
A quote Leonardo DeCaprrio, James Cameron in Coal Mine Operators, "We have to go deeper." But anyway, the problem with the Eurocentric why answers is that they all apply to either China or India or both.
"led directly to the Industrial Revolution by giving firm strong incentives to invent
"technologies that substituted capital and coal for labor." Ah, see I'm a little worried that people are going to still accuse me of Eurocentrism. Of course other people would accuse me of an anti-European bias.
Who inspired today's Danica drawing. Like the fact of coal being near the surface in Britain can't be chalked up to British cultural superiority but the wages question is a little different because it makes it sound like only Europeans were smart enough to pay high wages.

You are by now probably used to the idea of measuring angles in degrees. We use it in everyday language, we've done some examples on........ where if you had an angle like that, you might call that a 30 degree 30 degree angle if you had an angle like this call that a 90 degree angle you'd often use a symbol just like that. If you were to go a 180 degrees, you'd essentially form a straight line.
"Oh! they did a 360" or espescially in some type of some skateboarding competitions and things like that. But the one thing to realize is that it might not be obvious from the get-go but this whole notion of degrees, this is a human constructed system. this is not the only way that you can measure angles. And if you think about it yourselves,
So the videos that I've been making using these Python examples,
I've been using Python 2, which is kind of the standard version of Python that most of the implementations are in at the time of making this video. But there is also a Python 3, which is kind of the state of the art version of Python, or I guess you could say it's the newest version of Python. But it's not backwards compatible.
When I say backwards compatible, it means that if you are running Python 3, it will not necessarily be able to interpret everything that is written in Python 2. So that's what we mean by backwards compatibility:
You can't take a program that was written in Python 2— so let's take a program— that's the program right there— and let's say it runs fine in Python 2.
If you take that same program and try to run it in a Python 3 interpreter, it's not going to work. So this means, so this is not backwards compatible. If this did work, then Python 3 would be "backwards compatible".
And the whole reason— well you know this is actually a nice understanding of what even backwards compatibility means— but the whole point of making this video is the program that I ran in the last video will work in Python 2, but it will not work in Python 3.
And the reason why it doesn't work in Python 3 is
Python 3 has a different version... ...of this input function over here.
In Python 2, if you use the input function just like I used it— I put a message here for the user of what to input and when the user inputs something, it'll be returned to the program fully evaluated. So in this case, if the user enters a number,
In Python 3 the input function does something slightly different and it's enough to break this program if you were to try to run it in Python 3.
In Python 3, the input function doesn't return the evaluated expression, it returns a string— and this is a word you're going to... ...hear a lot of in computer science, and I'll explain it in multiple videos— but it returns a string of what the user inputted. And you're saying "Sal, what is a string?" And this is actually a good introduction:
In Python 3, if we just did this, and the user inputted 2 × 6— so once again the user inputs 2 × 6— then what's stored in the variable "number", what's returned from this function right over here, is not going to be 2 × 6 evaluated. It is going to be a string of characters that says "2 × 6". So this is the string and a string is really— you can view it as a string of characters. you can kind of view it as some text that's not actually interpreted in any way.
So if you want that original function to work in Python 3, what you have to do is put an— so instead of just calling "input" like this, you have to—and i will write it below this— you'd have to write "eval" and then write "input"— and then you write "input" and then it quotes all of the stuff I wrote up here, colons, close quotes, close parentheses and then close the eval() parentheses right over there. What eval() does is that it can take a string of characters, it can take some text like this. And it will evaluate it.
So what happens is that in Python 3 you'll get this string and when you eval it— so then you would do an eval() on this— so you're doing an eval() on the input()— the user puts some input, so then you're doing an eval() on what the user inputted, and then this will return 12.
So in Python 2, the input function kind of does it all for you, in Python 3 it returns a string and then you have to evaluate the string to get 12.
So if you try to do this in Python 3 and it broke, that is the reason why, you have to put an eval() around it.
Is two comma five a solution of this system? And we have a system of inequalities right over here. We have Y is greater than or equal to 2x plus 1 and X is greater than 1.
Y is greater than or equal to five. That's true! Five is equal to five.
Okay.

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Art Benjamin, and I am a "mathemagician." What that means is, I combine my loves of math and magic to do something I call "mathemagics."
But before I get started, I have a quick question for the audience. By any chance, did anyone happen to bring with them this morning a calculator? Seriously, if you have a calculator with you, raise your hand.
How about a two-digit number?
47. AB:
Multiply 22 times 47, make sure you get 1,034, or the calculators are not working. Do all of you get 1,034? 1,034?
Let's give three of them a nice round of applause there. (Applause) Would you like to try a more standard calculator, just in case?
There is something called the square of a number, which most of you know is taking a number and multiplying it by itself.
let me demonstrate with this one -- is by taking the number, such as five, hitting "times" and then "equals," and on most calculators that will give you the square.
On some of these ancient RPN calculators, you've got an "x squared" button on it, will allow you to do the calculation even faster. What I'm going to try and do now is to square, in my head, four two-digit numbers faster than they can do on their calculators, even using the shortcut method. What I'll use is the second row this time, and I'll get four of you to each yell out a two-digit number, and if you would square the first number, and if you would square the second, the third and the fourth,

Audience:
AB: 457 squared is 205,849. 205,849?
AB:
321 is 103,041. 103,041. Yes?
Oh, 722. AB: 722 is 500, that's a harder one.
Audience: 162. 162 squared is 26,244.
If each of you would call out a single digit between zero and nine, that will be the four-digit number that I'll square. Nine.
Seven.
Five.
Eight. 9,758, this will take me a little bit of time, so bear with me. 95 million -- (Sighs)
Seven, and yours?
Seven? And, uncertain. Seven.
Is there any possible way that I could know what seven-digit numbers you have? Say "No." (Laughter)
1, 9, 7, 0, 4, 2.
Did you leave out the number 6? Good, OK, that's one. You have a seven-digit number, call out any six of them please.
4, 4, 8, 7, 5. I think I only heard five numbers. I -- wait -- 44875 -- did you leave out the number 6?
0, 7, 9, 0, 4, 4.
I think you left out the number 3? AB: That's three.
2, 6, 3, 9, 7, 2.
Did you leave out the number 7? And let's give all four of these people a nice round of applause. Thank you very much.
For my next number -- (Laughter) while I mentally recharge my batteries, I have one more question for the audience. By any chance, does anybody here happen to know the day of the week that they were born on?
Audience: 1953.
1953, and the month? November what?
23rd -- was that a Monday? Audience: Yes.
1949, and the month?
October what?
Fifth -- was that a Wednesday? Yes! I'll go way to the back right now, how about you?
Audience:
1959.
Sixth -- was that a Friday? Audience: Yes.
Audience: 1947. AB:
1947, and the month? Audience: May.
Seventh -- would that be a Wednesday?
Audience: Yes. AB:
What year was it, first of all?
Audience:
What year would you like?
June. AB:
June what? CA: Sixth.
Was that a Sunday? CA: It was.
Five.

57,683 -- squared. Yuck. Let me explain to you how I'm going to attempt this problem.
While I explain something else -- (Laughter) -- I know, that you can use, right? (Laughter)
If you want to talk to me about ADHD afterwards, you can talk to me then. By the way, one last instruction, for my judges with the calculators -- you know who you are -- there is at least a 50 percent chance that I will make a mistake here. If I do, don't tell me what the mistake is; just say, "you're close," or something like that, and I'll try and figure out the answer -- which could be pretty entertaining in itself.
77,862 becomes cookie fission, cookie fission is 77,822. That seems right, I'll go on. Cookie fission, OK.
Take the 249, add that to cookie, 249, oops, but I see a carry coming -- 249 -- add that to cookie, 250 plus 77, is 327 million -- fission, fission, OK, finally, we do 683 squared, that's 700 times 666, plus 17 squared is 466,489, rev up if I need it, rev up, take the 466, add that to fission, to get, oh gee -- 328,489. Audience: Yeah!
My name is John Green and I wanna welcome you to Crash Course "World History" Over the next 14 weeks together we will learn how in nearly 15,000 years humans went from hunting and gathering... "Mr. Green, is this going to be on the test?"
In a mere 15,000 year humans went from hunting and gathering to creating such improbabilities as the airplane, the internet, and the 99 cent double cheeseburger. It's an extraordinary journey, one that I will now symbolize by embarking upon a journey of my own... over to camera 2...Hi there, camera 2, it's me, John Green, let's start with that double cheeseburger.
That's much better. So, early farmers who would find the most successful forms of wheat and plant them, and experiment with them, not because they were trying to start an agricultural revolution, because they were like, "You know what would be awesome?
We all know the scene:
Dorothy closes her eyes, and repeats the Good Witch's mantra,
"No coordinates exist like one's domicile, no coordinates exist like one's domicile, no coordinates exist like one's domicile."
Only Dorothy doesn't say that. She says five one-syilable words,
"There's no place like home." Each a word you probably learned in your first year of speaking, each perfectly concise. It's not that L. Frank Baum didn't have a thesaurus, it's that in most cases $10 words fail.
Would Aerosmith have had a hit with
"Ambulate This Direction?" Probably not.
Would Patrick Henry have ignited a revolution by saying, "Provide me with liberty or bestow upon me fatality?" Unlikely.

The event that prompted the building of this altar to peace, under Augustus, was Augustus' triumphal return from military campaigns in what is now Spain and France. - And when he returned, the senate vowed to create an altar commemorating the peace that he established in the Empire. And apparently on July 4th in the year 13 the sacred precinct was marked out on which the altar itself would be built.
And that was important to Mussolini because Mussolini identified himself with Augustus, the first emperor of Rome.
Mussolini was very much trying to reestablish a kind of Italian empire. We should talk a little bit about what an altar is. - Sure, when we talk about the Altar really what we are looking at is the walls of the precinct around what is in the middle of the Altar where sacrifices would have occurred.
- The Altar itself is interesting and important when we think about Augustus.
Augustus is establishing a centralized power. Rome had been since its earliest founding years when it was under the rule of kings, it had been controlled by the senate. It had been a republic.
So Rome was a republic and it really was a republic until Julius Caesar, who was the dictator and Augustus' uncle. And then Caesar is assassinated, there's civil war, and then peace is established by Augustus.
- Right. Augustus, whose real name was Octavian, was given the term Augustus as a kind of honorific as a way of representing his power.
And it's interesting the kind of politics that Augustus involved himself with. He gave great power back to the senate, but by doing so he established real and central authority for himself.
- He's looking back to the golden age of Greece, of the 5th century B.C., but he's also looking back to the Roman Republic. He's reestablishing some of the ancient rituals of traditional roman religion. He's embracing traditional Roman values.
- One of the most remarkable elements of the Ara Pacis is all of the highly decorative relief carving in the lower frieze. - And that goes all the way around it apparently shows more than 50 different species of plants; they're very natural in that we can identify these species but they're also highly abstracted and they form these beautiful, symmetrical, and linear patterns. - There is a real order that's given to the complexity of nature here.
- And art historians interpret all this as a symbol of fertility, of the abundance of the Golden Age that Augustus brought about. - We also see that same pattern repeated in the plasters that frame these panels. And then we also have meander, that moves horizontally around the entire exterior.
Some art historians think this figure represents Venus. Some think it represents the figure of peace, some the figure or Tellus, or Mother Earth. In any case, she is clearly a figure that suggests fertility and abundance.
like the goddesses on the Parthenon on the Acropolis in Greece. - And on her lap sit two children, one of whom offers her some fruit. There's fruit on her lap.
- Well, Augustus reigns after decades of civil war, after the assassination of Julius Caesar. So I think there's a powerful sense that this was the Golden Age. - So let's walk to the sides now and take a look at the procession.
If we think about this as looking back to the frieze on the parthenon from the Golden Age of Greece, those figures are all ideally beautiful, they don't represent anyone specific so much as the Athenian people, generally.
- But these are portraits. - That's right, and we can't always identify them for certain, but they really are specific individuals on a specific date, taking part in a specific event. - It's interesting to think about it because of course, throughout the
Meier's building which is so stark and modern, it's almost a little garish to imagine how brightly painted this would have been - they were pretty bright! - They were. So one of the things that Augustus said of himself was that he found
Augustus created an imperial city, and here we are 2000 years later in the Rome that Augustus created.

Let's talk about exactly how flu causes so much damage to ourselves and why it makes us feel so lousy whenever we get the flu. And I start up with drawing the flu virus here. This is our influenza virus,INFLUENZA VlRUS.
And so this RNA is important to remember because in the human cell in our cells, I'm going to draw one of our cells right here, we have instead of RNA we have DNA, remember. And so this is our nucleus.
And on the inside of the nucleus is our DNA. So this is our DNA over here. So the virus has RNA and we have DNA.
And this sialic acid becomes very important in understanding how the influenza virus gets into and out of our cells So the outside, remember, of the influenza virus there were couple of proteins And I'm gonna draw one of these proteins here.
And what hemagglutenin does is that it actually holds onto sialic acid.
In fact that's an easy way to remember, right, because H and H go together
It holds sialic acid. That becomes very important because that allows it the first step towards getting into the cell That is another protein on the outside here.
And once the influenza virus gets inside, these are RNA segments they're let loose. So these segments are gonna start making their way towards the nucleus.
So once they get into the nucleus they are in the same kind of area that DNA is. And what they do is remarkable. They basically take over.
These little RNA start making many copies of themselves. And what they want to do is make our human cell into a factory. They want to make a factory and this factory is gonna make little proteins, viroproteins.
And there is with the N is helpful for remembering it. It nicks or cuts sialic acid. It's if a nicker cut that sialic acid it can break free.
As I remember the two proteins as hemagglutinin holds sialic acid to enter the cell that is on entry and the neuraminidase is gonna nick the sialic acid and that important for exiting the cell. But we still haven't answered the question : how does all this cause our symptoms? or what happens is as these cells get turned into factories they start dying or getting damaged. And all their content start leaking out.
Welcome to this presentation on logarithm properties. Now this is going to be a very hands-on presentation. If you don't believe that one of these properties are true and you want them proved, I've made three or four videos that actually prove these properties.
But what I'm going to do is I'm going to show the properties and then show you how they can be used. It's going to be little more hands-on.
So let's just do a little bit of a review of just what a logarithm is. So if I say that "a"... oh that's not the right... Let's see.
Let's say I say that a-- Let me start over. a to the b is equal to c.
So if we-- a to the b power is equal to c. So another way to write this exact same relationship instead of writing the exponent, is to write it as a logarithm.
So we can say that the logarithm base a of c is equal to b.
So this are essentially saying the same thing, they just have different kind of results.
In one, you know a and b and you're kind of getting c. That's what exponentiation does for you. And the second one, you know a and you know that when you raise it to some power you get c.
And then you figure out what b is. So they're the exact same relationship, just stated in a different way. Now I will introduce you to some interesting
logarithm properties. And they actually just fall out of this relationship and the regular exponent rules. So the first is that the logarithm-- Let me do a more cheerful color.
The logarithm, let's say, of any base-- So let's just call the base-- Let's say b for base.
Logarithm base b of a plus logarithm base b of c-- and this only works if we have the same bases. So that's important to remember. That equals the logarithm of base b of a times c.
So let's say logarithm of base two of-- I don't know --of eight plus logarithm base two of-- I don't know let's say --thirty-two.
So, in theory, this should equal, if we believe this property, this should equal logarithm base two of what?
Well we say eight times thirty-two. So eight times thirty-two is two hundred and forty plus sixteen, two hundred and fifty-six. Well let's see if that's true.
So log-- So this is-- We just used our property. This little property that I presented to you. And let's just see if it works out.
So log base two of eight. two to what power is equal to eight? Well two to the third power is equal to eight, right? So this term right here, that equals three, right?
Log base two of eight is equal to three. two to what power is equal to thirty-two? Let's see. two to the fourth power is sixteen. two to the fifth power is thirty-two. So this right here is two to the-- This is five, right?
And two to the what power is equal to two hundred and fifty-six? Well if you're a computer science major, you'll know that immediately.
That a bite can have two hundred and fifty-six values in it. So it's two to the eighth power. But if you don't know that, you could multiply it out yourself.
And what makes the logarithms interesting is and why-- It's a little confusing at first. And you can watch the proofs if you really want kind of a rigorous-- my proofs aren't rigorous. But if you want kind of a better explanation of how this works.
Let's say log base three of-- I don't know --log base three of-- well you know, let's make it interesting --log base three of one / nine minus log base three of eighty-one. So this property tells us-- This is the same thing as-- Well I'm ending up with a big number.
Log base three of one / nine divided by eighty-one. So that's the same thing as one / nine times one / eighty-one. I used two large numbers for my example, but we'll move forward.
Well three squared is equal to nine, right? So three-- So we know that if three squared is equal to nine, then we
know that three to the negative two is equal to one / nine, right? The negative just inverts it. So this is equal to negative two, right?
So we have minus two minus four is equal to-- Well, we could do it a couple of ways.
Minus two minus four is equal to minus six. And now we just have to confirm that three to the minus sixth power is equal to one / seven hundred and twenty-nine. So that's my question.
In the next video, I'll introduce you to the last two logarithm properties. And, if we have time, maybe I'll do examples with the leftover time. I'll see you soon.
[piano music] We're looking at the famous sculpture called
"The Dying Gaul" in the Capitoline Museum in Rome and this is a copy of a sculpture that dates from the third century B.C. - the original. So this is a Roman copy of an ancient Greek original. But a Greek sculpture that would have actually come originally from Pergamon, on the coast of what is now Turkey.
Right, in one of the areas that was a Greek colony... and it was to commemorate an important battle over a group that the Greeks would have looked at as barbarians. It's interesting because in earlier Greek history, if this Gaul was to be represented as defeated, he would have been represented as a barbarian, as somebody who was inherently less than the Greeks, and although I think that you can still make the argument that that's the case if you look at his hair - it's roughly handled, his face - his brow is large, his nose is not as idealized as the Greeks might have represented themselves, nevertheless we see his pain. We do.
Before we go into the actual conflict of the Korean War, let's try to get a sense of the historical environment going into the Korean War. So if you go all the way back to the late 1800s early 1900s, the Korean peninsula, what we now consider both North and South Korea, they were occupied by the Japanese military.
North Korea's dad. This is Kim Jong Il's dad. So he gets installed in the north.
Syngmyn Rhee wants to unite Korea under his authoritarian rule. So they're both kind of setting up troops along the border. And this whole time you have skirmishes going on across the border.
And the Korean War really just starts becoming into a game of Risk. I don't know if you've ever played the game of Risk, but whenever somebody's turn, they are able to spread their forces but then they get spread in. And the other side is able to come back.
And why don't we use our navy to do an amphibious landing of an army at Incheon. So in Septmeber 15, well you have kind of the stalemate over here. The United States, they have an amphibious landing, so they send troops from all of these places.
They have an amphibious landing at Incheon which is near Seoul. So, they land right over... they land at Incheon, which is roughly over there (I'm not super accurate here). And what's interesting about that is that in any battle, all of these Korean troops, right here, they have supply chains.
Syngmyn Rhee, when he was--- the first time when North Korean troops were rolling in to South Korea, he essentially, beforehand, he was kind of imprisoning a bunch of people who he suspected to be Communist. When I'm talking about "people," I'm talking about whole families, sometimes.
I'd like to begin with an aspiration. "May you hear something today that ignites a spark in your consciousness and enables you to live a life that is in alignment with your highest ideals and deepest values." Easier said than done, right?
Don't worry, I'm not going to tell you to ask your doctor if X, Y, or Z medication is right for you. But I want to propose something much simpler that can be practiced by people of all ages. Possible side effects may include:
You can start by dropping the awareness into the body. Gently focus on the rising and falling of the in and out breath.
You are likely to have thoughts competing for your attention. When you notice this is happening, gently bring your awareness back to the sensation of the breath.
(Meditation gong sound)
Thank you for joining me for that experience. And hopefully, you'll see that it doesn't have to be complicated or mystical. It can be as simple as setting aside some time in the morning or before you go to bed at night, and stopping throughout the day to take a few mindful breaths.
Use the associative law of multiplication to write-- and here they have 12 times 3 in parentheses, and then they want us to multiply that times 10-- in a different way. Simplify both expressions to show they have identical results. So the way that they wrote it is-- let me just rewrite it.

Now, let's think about expressions with more than one variable. So, let's say I had the expression "a + b" and I were to ask you what is this expression equal to when "a" is equal to 5 and "b" is equal to 7
3 times 5 is 15. So, it is -10 - 15, which is equal to -25. And now, you have the next exercise to practice some of these a little bit more.
The starting block below is 16/9 units long. So this right here is 16/9 units long. Use the tools to the right to convert the starting block into the goal block that is 1 unit long.
Hi there, I'm John Green; you're watching Crash Course: World History, and today we're gonna talk about the Silk Road, so called because it was not a road and not made of silk. So this is a t-shirt.
Mr. Green Mr. Green the t-shirt can't see the world because they don't have eyes—
Look, me from the past, it's difficult for me to isolate what I hate most about you because there is so much to hate. But very near the top is your relentless talent for ignoring everything that is interesting and beautiful about our species in favor of pedantic sniveling in which no one loses or gains anything of value. I'm gonna go put on a collared shirt because we're here to tackle the big picture.
It's not like archaeologists working in Uzbekistan have uncovered a bunch of yield signs and baby on board stickers. It was an overland route where merchants carried goods for trade. But it was really two routes:
One group of such nomads, the Yuezhi, were humiliated in battle in the 2nd century BCE by their bitter rivals the Xiongnu, who turned the Yuezhi king's skull into a drinking cup, in fact. And in the wake of that the Yuezhi migrated to Bactria and started the Kushan Empire in what is now Afghanistan and Pakistan. Although silk road trading began more than a century before the birth of Jesus, it really took off in the second and third centuries CE, and the Kushan Empire became a huge hub for that silk road trade.
Silk was so popular among the Roman elite that the Roman senate repeatedly tried to ban it, complaining about trade imbalances caused by the silk trade and also that silk was inadequately modest. To quote Seneca the Younger,
"I see clothes of silk, if materials that do not hide the body, nor even one's decency, can be called clothes," he also said of the woman who wears silk, "her husband has no more acquaintance than any outsider or foreigner with his wife's body." And yet all attempts to ban silk failed, which speaks to how much, even in the ancient world, wealth shaped governance. And with trade, there was a way to become wealthy without being a king or lord who takes part of what your citizens produce.
Mr. Putin, I just want to state for the record that I did not mean that in any way, I was--- Stan wrote that joke. Oh, it's time for the Open Letter.
This last plague—known as the Black Death—resulted in the largest population decimation in human history, with nearly half of Europeans dying in a four-year period. A sizable majority of people living in Italy died as did two-thirds of Londoners. And it quite possibly wouldn't have happened without the Silk Road.

So, people want a lot of things out of life, but I think, more than anything else, they want happiness. Aristotle called happiness "the chief good," the end towards which all other things aim. According to this view, the reason we want a big house or a nice car or a good job isn't that these things are intrinsically valuable.
Well, since I'm a scientist, I'd like to try to resolve this debate with some data, and in particular I'd like to present some data to you from three questions that I ask with Track Your Happiness. Remember, this is from sort of moment-to-moment experience in people's real lives.
Consider the following experiment. You have two pieces of metal - copper and zinc - which you connect to conducting wires. And you then submerge the metals in an electrolyte - in this case, vinegar.
"Write a mathematical expression which corresponds to x time y minus a times b times c."
I wrote this poem after hearing a pretty well known actress tell a very well known interviewer on television,
"I'm really getting into the Internet lately. I just wish it were more organized." So ... (Laughter)
Grandma.com would be a recipe for biscuits and spit-bath instructions. One, two, three. That links with hotdiggitydog.com.
I'd like to upgrade to deity and maybe just like that -- pop! -- I'd go wireless. (Laughter)
I could zip through your servers and firewalls like a virus until the World Wide Web is as wise, as wild and as organized as I think a modern-day miracle/oracle can get, but, ooh-eee, you want to bet just how whack and un-PC your Mac or PC is going to be when I'm rocking hot-shit-hot-shot-god.net?
I guess it's just like life. It is not a question of if you can -- it's: do ya? We can interfere with the interface.
In order to have a respectable understanding of the Vietnam War, we have to rewind all the way back to the late 1800s, when France was colonizing Southeast Asia-- and in particular colonizing what is now Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia. They were collectively called French Indo-China. We can see Cambodia here, and Vietnam along the coast, and then Laos right over here.
One, the gulf of Tonkin, well, it's not clear that really anything happened. there might have been some firing from the USS Maddox they might have actually engaged the North Vietnamese patrol boats The other possibility that might have happened is that nothing happened. So, but, either way you look at it, it's now been fairly established that it was not a real incident.
I mentioned in the last several videos that the coefficient of kinetic friction tends to be less sometimes little bit roughly equal to the coefficient of static friction but this might lead you to at least a question that I have had in my mind and I still have to some degree that why is the coefficient of kinetic friction lower or why can it be lower? And the current best theory that I can visualize in my head and based on the readings that I have done is the difference between-- so let's think about it this way Look at a regular human level maybe we have a block, so this is the static case.
So there is never this thing like real what we imagine in our head real contact and if you really want to blow your mind and watch the chemistry videos if you want to understand this is that most of this atoms are actually free space themselves as the electron cloud is huge relative or I guess where most of the probability of finding the electrons is huge compared to the size of the electron or the size of the nucleus. So it's kind of just a lot of free space pushing on lot of other free space through the electromagnetic force
Let's see if we can write the fraction "11 over 25" (or we can call it "eleven twenty-fifths") to see if we can write that as a decimal and we're gonna round it to the nearest thousands place. And so another way of viewing this, eleven over twenty-five, this is the same thing as eleven divided by twenty-five, so we can literally say, we can literally divide 25 into 11 and whatever we get that is going to be the decimal representation of 11/25. And, since we're going to go into the places less than the ones place we're gonna go into the tenths place and the hundredths place and the thousandths place,
So let's get some practice at simplifying polynomials, especially in the case where we have more than one variable over here so I have 4x squared y minus 3x squared minus 2 y so that entire expression plus the entire expression 8xy minus 3x squared plus 2x squared y plus 4
So the first thing that jumps out at me is that I'm just adding this expression to this expression so to a large degree these parentheses don't matter, so I can just rewrite it as 4x squared y minus 3x squared minus 2y plus 8xy minus 3x squared plus 2x squared y plus 4 Now we can try to group similar terms or like terms So let's think about what we have over here
So I have negative 3 x squared-s. Do I have any more x squared-s in this expression right over here?
Well, sure, I have another negative 3 x squared so if I have negative 3 of something and then another negative 3 I end up with negative 6 of that thing. So it's negative 6 x squared.
So we can make sure we really understand what's happening in this little iterative fibonacci fuction I am going to step through it with a particular example So we are going to assume that this function is called with the argument 5.
So we want the 5th term in the fibonacci sequance.
Starting at where indexing thing starting at 0. So the 0th term will be the... really... sometimes you would imagine the 1st term to be. Will start with the 0th term.
So we're assuming that fibonacci of 5 is called. So we want the 5th term. Starting at the 0th term, so we want 5th one.
So what I've done here is: I'm going really to focus what happens in this loop so as we enter into this loop the first time that we entered to this loop terms is refering to a list that has just 0 and 1 in it.
And we did that because by definition those are the first two terms of the fibonacci sequence and then also entering into in the loop we defined i as beeing equal to... i as beeing equal to 2 and we do that because we've already defined the 0th term and the 1st term and so now we want to as we enter the loop... start... we want to add... we want to add the second term as we go into the loop and then we say while i is less than or equal to n.
Well we already know that n is 5. So in the scope of this function while we are running it, the variable n is 5. And so clearly i is still less than or equal to 5 so we will run this code right over here and we are appending to terms so we are going to append something.
So entering into this clause is what i in terms would look like. But looks like we are going to append something to terms so terms is going to look like... Terms is going to be 0 and 1 and there we are going to add something...
And then we go back. We loop back up to the beginning of the while loop and we say while i is less than or equal to n. Well now i is a little bit closer to n.
Once again entering into the loop. Terms now looks like this: 0, 1, 1. i looks like this, 3.
It's really what the same values we had exiting the loop and now we evaluate right over here. We are going to add something to terms. So terms right now:
3 minus 1 is 2. So this right over here is now going to be 2. So it's going to be the second indexed term in terms so this is the 0th, the 1st the 2nd.
3 minus 2 is 1. So plus the first term in terms. So this is the 0th term in the 1st term so this is also going to be a 1 over here.
Entering the loop, now i is equal to 4. I'm going to do that in the same orange colour. Entering into the loop i is equal to 4 and the terms...
I is 4. 4 minus 2 is 2.
The 2nd term in terms is 0, 1, 2. It's a 1. It's this one right over here.
Then we go to the beginning of the loop. I is now going to be equal to 5. Terms.
Terms are now: 0, 1, 1, 2 and 3 and then we say while i is less than or equal to n. N is 5.
Well 5 is still less than or equal to 5. It's equal to 5 so this still is true so we'll execute this clause and now we have to figure out... Let me clear this out again.
So now i is 5. so it's 5 minus 1. So it's the 4th term in terms. So 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.
5 minus 2 is 3. the 3rd term in terms:
0, 1, 2, 3 is this over here. So this over here is 2. So you evaluate this.
So i is equal to 5 plus 1 or 6.
I is equal to 6 now.
When we go to the beginning of the loop and it says while i is less than or equal to n.
6 is not less than or equal to 5 so this is false. So we do not... We break out of the loop and we go to...
So this is the 0th term, 1st term, 2nd term, 3rd term, 4th term, 5th term. And we are done. And hopefully that gives you and understanding of why this works and also a little bit of the logic of how we wrote it.
It's literally building up the fibonacci sequence so the way you would expect to. It started with the first 2 terms by definition and then each time we went to the loop and added another term it said hey, the new term is going to be the sum of the last term right now and the second to last term and add them together and that will be the new term and you keep doing that until you have essentially... until you have added that nth term.
Write the following numbers as complex numbers. And just as a little review. A complex number is a number that has a real part or an imaginary part.
Arguably, one of the most important molecules in all of biology is ATP.
ATP, which stands for adenosine triphosphate.
Which sounds very fancy.
But all you need to remember, or any time you see ATP hanging around in some type of biochemical reaction, something in your brain should say, hey, we're dealing with biological energy. Or another way to think of ATP is the currency-- I'll put that in quotes-- of biological energy.
So how is it a currency of energy?
Well ATP stores energy in its bonds. And I'll explain what that means in a second.
And before we learn what an adenosine group or a 3-phosphate group looks like, you can just take a bit of a leap of faith, that you could imagine ATP as being made up of something called-- let me do it in a nice color-- an adenosine group right there. And then attached to it you'll have three phosphates.
Tri- meaning three phosphate groups. Now if you take adenosine triphosphate and you hydrolyze this bond, which means if you take this in the presence of water. So let me just throw some water in here.
And so when I talk about ATP being the currency of biological energy, this is why.
Is that if you have ATP, and if you were to-- through some chemical reaction-- you pop off this phosphate right here.
It's going to generate energy. That energy can be used for just general heat. Or you could couple this reaction with other reactions that require energy.
And this is really all you--well this is 95% of what you need to know to really understand the function of ATP in biological systems. It's just a store of energy when you-- ATP has energy. When you break a phosphate off, it generates energy.
And then if you want to go from ADP and a phosphate back to ATP, you have to use energy up again.
If you have ADP and you want ATP, you need to use energy. And so far I've just drawn a circle with an A around it and said that's an adenosine. But sometimes I think it's satisfying to see what the molecule actually looks like.
While the conceptual reason why ATP is the currency of energy, I think is fairly straightforward.
When it has three phosphates, one phosphate can break off. And then that'll result with some energy being put into the system. Or if you want to attach that phosphate you have to use up energy.
Which is the same adenine that makes up the nucleotides that are the backbone of DNA. So some of these molecules in biological systems have more than one use. This is the same adenine where we talk about adenine and guanine.
In the last video, we talked about the idea that If I dug up a bone someplace and if I were to measure its carbon 14 I found that it had half the carbon 14 that I would expect to find in a living animal or plant. Then I would say hey, maybe 1 half life is gone by or roughly for Carbon 14 one half life is 5,730 years.
There have been many revolutions over the last century, but perhaps none as significant as the longevity revolution. We are living on average today 34 years longer than our great-grandparents did -- think about that. That's an entire second adult lifetime that's been added to our lifespan.
And they are asking -- we should all be asking: How do we use this time?
How do we live it successfully?
What is the appropriate new metaphor for aging? I've spent the last year researching and writing about this subject. And I have come to find that a more appropriate metaphor for aging is a staircase -- the upward ascension of the human spirit, bringing us into wisdom, wholeness, and authenticity.
About three years ago, I read an article in the New York Times. It was about a man named Neil Selinger -- 57 years old, a retired lawyer, who had joined the writers' group at Sarah Lawrence, where he found his writer's voice. Two years later, he was diagnosed with ALS, commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease.
"As my muscles weakened, my writing became stronger. As I slowly lost my speech, I gained my voice.
How was I supposed to live it? What was I supposed to accomplish in this final act? And I realized that, in order to know where I was going,
I discovered, a couple of years later, that this process that I had gone through is called by psychologists "doing a life review." And they say it can give new significance and clarity and meaning to a person's life. You may discover, as I did, that a lot of things that you used to think were your fault, a lot of things you used to think about yourself, really had nothing to do with you.
Now while I was writing about this, I came upon a book called "Man's Search for Meaning" by Viktor Frankl.
Viktor Frankl was a German psychiatrist who'd spent five years in a Nazi concentration camp. And he wrote that, while he was in the camp, he could tell, should they ever be released, which of the people would be OK, and which would not. And he wrote this:
"Everything you have in life can be taken from you except one thing: your freedom to choose how you will respond to the situation. This is what determines the quality of the life we've lived -- not whether we've been rich or poor, famous or unknown, healthy or suffering. What determines our quality of life is how we relate to these realities, what kind of meaning we assign them, what kind of attitude we cling to about them, what state of mind we allow them to trigger."
A lot of people, including myself, have found the study of World War I to be a little bit confusing sometimes. And I think the reason is, the world was very different, leading up to World War I, than it is today.
We recognize the United Kingdom. (Well, Ireland has since been carved out.) But the United Kingdom's boundaries are not very different now than they were then.
And that's another confusing thing for many of us, the fact that 'Bosnia and Herzegovina' is actually the name of just one country. It's called "Bosnia and Herzegovina." Or I guess, for the Austro-Hungarians, that was, I guess now, one region that they annexed.
This was then part of the dying Ottoman Empire. At its peak, the Ottoman Empire controlled much of the Muslim world. It controlled Northern Africa, as well as all the stuff that you see here - and even a little bit of Persia, and actually a good bit of the Balkans,
John: Hi, I'm John Green. This is Crash Course World History and today we're going to talk about World War Il.
Mr. Green!
Mr. Green!
Is this going to be like one of the unfunny ones where you build to the big melodramatic conclusion about how I have to imagine the world more complexly? Me from the past, as long as you have that 8th rate soup strainer, I'm not even going to acknowledge your existence.
In September 1939 when the Nazis invaded Poland? I'd say, no. It actually started when
But the World War II we know the most about from movies and TV is primarily the war in the European theatre, the one that Adolf Hitler started. Hitler is the rare individual who really did make history, specifically, he made it worse. If he hadn't existed, it's very unlikely that
"Man, the Queen wants me to finish my term paper so I can do it," but when this poster was first produced in 1939, it was to quell terror in the face of bombardment.
The Battle of Britain was a duel between the Royal Air Force and the Luftwaffe.
While the RAF denied the Nazi's total control of British air space, the Nazis were still able to bomb Great Britain over and over again in what's known as "The Blitz". Stan, no! No jokes this time!
This is where British General Monty Montgomery outfoxed Erwin the "Desert Fox" Rommel. It's also the place where Americans first fought Nazis in large numbers, but most importantly, it's where Indiana Jones discovered the Ark of the Covenant. Okay, let's go to the Thought Bubble.
Thanks, Thought Bubble.
So not to sound jingoistic, but the entry of the US into the war really did change everything, although I doubt the Nazis could have taken Russia regardless. No one conquers Russia in the wintertime unless you are ... wait for it ... the Mongols. (horses running)
Of the 91,000 Axis POWs from Stalingrad, only about 6,000 ever returned home. Stalingrad turned the war in Europe and by 1944, the American strategy of island-hopping in the Pacific was taking Gls closer and closer to Japan, Rome was liberated in June by Americans and Canadians, and its successful British Canadian and American D-Day invasion of Normandy was the beginning of the end for the Nazis.
Oh! It's Canadian mittens! I want to thank the Canadian Crash Course fans who sent us these mittens.
Canadians are just so nice, Stan! All we ever do on this show is make fun of them and they're just like, "It's so kind of you to mention us. Here's some mittens!"
Great Britain from the beginning of the war and you were there on D-Day successfully invading Juno Beach. And as many of you have pointed out in comments, you defeated the United States in the war of 1812, meaning arguably Canada, you are the greater military power plus you have lumberjacks and excellent beer and hockey and universal health care and Justin Bieber! I'm jealous!
German offensive at the Battle of the Bulge in the winter of 1944, 1945 failed. Mussolini was executed in April of 1945. Hitler committed suicide at the end of that month, and on May 8, 1945, the allies declared victory in Europe after Germany surrendered unconditionally.
Stan just said that was hyperbole, but it's not. Stalin's Soviet Union is tied with all of the other completely undemocratic countries for last place on the democracy scale.
"Homo Homini Lupus", "Man is a wolf to man." This is seen most clearly in the Holocaust, but all the statistics are staggering. More than a million Indian British subjects died mainly due to famine that could have been avoided if the British had redistributed food, and their failure to do so helped convince
From the firebombing of Dresden to Tokyo to Hiroshima, the line between soldier and civilian, blurred. And of course, there is the Holocaust which horrifies us because the elements of western progress, record keeping, industrial production, technology were used to slaughter millions. World War II saw modern industrial nations which represented the best of the enlightenment and the scientific revolution descend into once unimaginable cruelty.
Alright, now we have a very interesting situation. On both sides of the scale, we have our mystery mass and now I'm calling the mystery mass having a mass of Y.
Just to show you that it doesn't always have to be X. It can be any symbol as long as you can keep track of that symbol. But all these have the same mass.
(piano music playing)
We're in the National Gallery of Washington, D.C., and we're looking at Franรงois Boucher's
Beth: It is. We see Venus occupying a diagonal line in the center of the canvas.
Steven: Which reminds us that it comes out of the
Beth:
Baroque
Beth: Yeah, lovely nude Venus who has got her left arm coming across her body and trying to steal all the arrows from Cupid, so he can't ...
Steven: ... do mischief ...
Beth: Do mischief making people fall in love.
Steven: The arrow, the spark of desire that he wields.
Yeah and there's sorts of soft greens and blues and pinks that we associate with the Rococo style.
Steven: There's a willingness to sort of suspend belief and to create a kind of fantasy, to create a kind of impossible dream-like space.
Beth: No, that's not a real construction of space.
Steven: No, not at all.
Beth: It's a kind of evoking of nature and landscape.
It's meant to be a kind of playful indulgent expression of wealth thinned of emotion and of love and desire.
Beth: And of course, this was commissioned by Madame de Pompadour?
Steven: ... who was the mistress of the king and there's even some suggestion that it was possibly her that posed for Venus, although I think ...
Beth: It's just that she's a very idealized woman.
Steven: Yeah, I think that's probably true, but it speaks a lot to ... to the interest of the moment. You know, this is a period before the French Revolution, where painting was concerned with ... with emotion, was concerned with the kind of indulgence ... was concerned with other pleasures of the body.
A theater has a total of 63 seats in a rectangular grid. Here they are right over here. It currently has 9 rows, each with an equal number of seats.
What I want to do in this video is find the area of the region in the first quadrant right over here that's below the graph of y is equals to square root of x, but above the graph of y is equal to x squared. So we're talking about this region right over here. And we know what the two endpoints are.
Two six sided dice are rolled one-thousand times, and the sums of the two dice are recorded. For example, if an 3 and a 4 are rolled, a sum of seven is recorded...sounds reasonable. The results are in the table below.
Think about this real world problem. To estimate the population of a town in upcoming years, one of the town workers collected populations from past years and made this table. So they have years starting with 1950 and going up by increments of 10 years.
So it's looking for a trend or a pattern and then generalizing.
You could imagine, it's kind of extrapolating the information you have, generalizing. Deductive reasoning is taking some set of data or some set of facts and using that to come up with other, or deducing some other, facts that you know are true. When you generalize you don't know necessarily whether the trend will continue, but you assume it will.
So as a fashion designer, I've always tended to think of materials something like this, or this, or maybe this. But then I met a biologist, and now I think of materials like this -- green tea, sugar, a few microbes and a little time.
"Spin me a thread. Align it in this direction. Make it hydrophobic.
Bruno Giussani:
Suzanne, just a curiosity, what you're wearing is not random. (Suzanne Lee: No.)
SL: Yes, it is. It's probably -- part of the project's still in process because this one is actually biodegrading in front of your eyes.
BG: Okay, so we'll let you go and save it, and rescue it.
Suzanne Lee. (SL: Thank you.) (Applause)
By the end of this year, there'll be nearly a billion people on this planet that actively use social networking sites. The one thing that all of them have in common is that they're going to die. While that might be a somewhat morbid thought,
And what Miller did was have his family and friends write a post that went out shortly after he died. Here's what he wrote in starting that out. He said, "Here it is.
Miller's archive may have been better written and more carefully curated than most, the fact of the matter is that all of us today are creating an archive that's something completely different than anything that's been created by any previous generation. Consider a few stats for a moment. Right now there are 48 hours of video being uploaded to YouTube every single minute.
One of them actually, fittingly enough, found me when I checked into a deli at a restaurant in New York on foursquare. (Recording) Adam Ostrow: Hello.
Death can catch you anywhere, anytime, even at the Organic.
AO: Who is this? Death:
Adam Ostrow: Kind of creepy, right? So what that service does, quite simply, is let you create a message or a video that can be posted to Facebook after you die.
I think as machines' ability to understand human language and process vast amounts of data continues to improve, it's going to become possible to analyze an entire life's worth of content -- the Tweets, the photos, the videos, the blog posts -- that we're producing in such massive numbers. And I think as that happens, it's going to become possible for our digital personas to continue to interact in the real world long after we're gone thanks to the vastness of the amount of content we're creating and technology's ability to make sense of it all. Now we're already starting to see some experiments here.
One service called My Next Tweet analyzes your entire Twitter stream, everything you've posted onto Twitter, to make some predictions as to what you might say next. Well right now, as you can see, the results can be somewhat comical. You can imagine what something like this might look like five, 10 or 20 years from now as our technical capabilities improve.
MlT's media lab is working on robots that can interact more like humans. But what if those robots were able to interact based on the unique characteristics of a specific person based on the hundreds of thousands of pieces of content that person produces in their lifetime?
Finally, think back to this famous scene from election night 2008 back in the United States, where CNN beamed a live hologram of hip hop artist will.i.am into their studio for an interview with Anderson Cooper. What if we were able to use that same type of technology to beam a representation of our loved ones into our living rooms -- interacting in a very lifelike way based on all the content they created while they were alive? I think that's going to become completely possible as the amount of data we're producing and technology's ability to understand it both expand exponentially.
What i wanna do in this video is give a very high level overview of the 4 fundamental forces of the universe And I'm gonna start with gravity. and it might surprise some of you that gravity is actually the weakest of the 4 fundamental forces And that is surpring cause thats what keeps us glued, well not glued, but what keeps us from jumping off the planet its what keeps the moon in orbit around the earth the earth in orbit around the sun the sun in orbit around the center of milky way galaxy.
Now, the weak interaction is what's responsible for one of its neutrons, essentially for one of its quarks flipping and turning into a proton and I'm not going to detail of what a quark is, and all of that and the math can get pretty hairy but i want to give you an example of what a weak interaction does so if one of these neutrons turns into a proton we're going to have one extra proton but we're going to have the same number of nucleons instead of an extra neutron you have an extra proton here and now it is a different atom it is now barium and in that flipping, it will actually emit an electon and, an anti-electron neutrino I'm not going to go into the details of what anti-electron neutrino is these are fundamental particles but this is just what the weak interaction is it's not something that is really obvoius to us it's not just these traditional things pulling and pushing away from each other like we associate with the other forces
and although, you've probably haven't seen this yet in chemistry classes it actually applies very strongly in chemistry because when you first learn about atoms, lemme draw a helium atom A helium atoms ha two protons in his nucleus and it has two neutrons, and the it also has two electrons circulating around So it has electron, and I can draw the electron much smaller
These rocks have been hitting our earth for about three billion years, and are responsible for much of what's gone on on our planet. This is an example of a real meteorite, and you can see all the melting of the iron from the speed and the heat when a meteorite hits the earth, and just how much of it survives and melts. From a meteorite from space, we're over here with an original Sputnik.
The space age began 50 years ago in October, and that's exactly what Sputnik looked like.
And it wouldn't be fun to talk about the space age without seeing a flag that was carried to the moon and back, on Apollo 11. The astronauts each got to carry about ten silk flags in their personal kits. They would bring them back and mount them.
And it wouldn't be interesting to talk about the dawn of books without having a copy of a Guttenberg Bible. You can see how portable and handy it was to have your own Guttenberg in 1455. But what's interesting about the Guttenberg Bible, and the dawn of this technology, is not the book.
It's designed like an Escher print. Here is some of the lower level of the library, where the exhibits constantly change. You can walk through.
And Eileen and I are thrilled to open our home and share it with the TED community.
TED is all about patterns in the clouds. It's all about connections. It's all about seeing things that everybody else has seen before but thinking about them in ways that nobody has thought of them before.
I'm a storyteller. And I would like to tell you a few personal stories about what I like to call "the danger of the single story." I grew up on a university campus in eastern Nigeria.
"Finish your food!
Don't you know? People like Fide's family have nothing." So I felt enormous pity for Fide's family.
Years later, I thought about this when I left Nigeria to go to university in the United States. I was 19. My American roommate was shocked by me.
Never mind that I knew nothing about places like Namibia. But I did come to embrace this new identity, and in many ways I think of myself now as African. Although I still get quite irritable when Africa is referred to as a country, the most recent example being my otherwise wonderful flight from Lagos two days ago, in which there was an announcement on the Virgin flight about the charity work in "India, Africa and other countries."
(Laughter) So, after I had spent some years in the U.S. as an African, I began to understand my roommate's response to me.
I would see Africans in the same way that I, as a child, had seen Fide's family. This single story of Africa ultimately comes, I think, from Western literature. Now, here is a quote from the writing of a London merchant called John Lok, who sailed to west Africa in 1561 and kept a fascinating account of his voyage.
And one must admire the imagination of John Lok. But what is important about his writing is that it represents the beginning of a tradition of telling African stories in the West: A tradition of Sub-Saharan Africa as a place of negatives, of difference, of darkness, of people who, in the words of the wonderful poet Rudyard Kipling, are "half devil, half child."
And so, I began to realize that my American roommate must have throughout her life seen and heard different versions of this single story, as had a professor, who once told me that my novel was not "authentically African." Now, I was quite willing to contend that there were a number of things wrong with the novel, that it had failed in a number of places, but I had not quite imagined that it had failed at achieving something called African authenticity. In fact, I did not know what African authenticity was.
I remember walking around on my first day in Guadalajara, watching the people going to work, rolling up tortillas in the marketplace, smoking, laughing. I remember first feeling slight surprise. And then, I was overwhelmed with shame.
There is a word, an Igbo word, that I think about whenever I think about the power structures of the world, and it is "nkali." It's a noun that loosely translates to "to be greater than another." Like our economic and political worlds, stories too are defined by the principle of nkali:
I had read Tyler and Updike and Steinbeck and Gaitskill.
I did not have a single story of America. When I learned, some years ago, that writers were expected to have had really unhappy childhoods to be successful, I began to think about how I could invent horrible things my parents had done to me.
Muhtar Bakare, a remarkable man who left his job in a bank to follow his dream and start a publishing house? Now, the conventional wisdom was that Nigerians don't read literature. He disagreed.
"I really liked your novel. I didn't like the ending. Now, you must write a sequel, and this is what will happen ..." (Laughter)
Now, what if my roommate knew about my friend Funmi Iyanda, a fearless woman who hosts a TV show in Lagos, and is determined to tell the stories that we prefer to forget? What if my roommate knew about the heart procedure that was performed in the Lagos hospital last week? What if my roommate knew about contemporary Nigerian music, talented people singing in English and Pidgin, and Igbo and Yoruba and Ijo, mixing influences from Jay-Z to Fela to Bob Marley to their grandfathers.
What if my roommate knew about the female lawyer who recently went to court in Nigeria to challenge a ridiculous law that required women to get their husband's consent before renewing their passports?
What if my roommate knew about Nollywood, full of innovative people making films despite great technical odds, films so popular that they really are the best example of Nigerians consuming what they produce?
What if my roommate knew about my wonderfully ambitious hair braider, who has just started her own business selling hair extensions? Or about the millions of other Nigerians who start businesses and sometimes fail, but continue to nurse ambition? Every time I am home I am confronted with the usual sources of irritation for most Nigerians: our failed infrastructure, our failed government, but also by the incredible resilience of people who thrive despite the government, rather than because of it.
My Nigerian publisher and I have just started a non-profit called Farafina Trust, and we have big dreams of building libraries and refurbishing libraries that already exist and providing books for state schools that don't have anything in their libraries, and also of organizing lots and lots of workshops, in reading and writing, for all the people who are eager to tell our many stories. Stories matter. Many stories matter.
Well, welcome back! I'm going to show you the last two logarithm properties now. So this one-- and I always found this one to be in some ways the most obvious one.
So the next logarithm property is, if I have A times the logarithm base B of C, if I have A times this whole thing, then that equals logarithm base B of C to the A power. Fascinating. So let's see if this works out.
So this property tells us that this is going to be the same thing as logarithm base two of eight to the third power. And that's the same thing. Well, that's the same thing as-- we could figure it out.
I implicitly want to use log and exponential rules to do it. So I'm trying to avoid that. Anyway, going back.
Because log base two of five hundred and twelve is going to be equal to nine. What's eight to the third? It's sixty-four-- right. eight squared is sixty-four, so eight cubed-- let's see. four times eight. so, it's two and three. six times eight-- looks like it's five hundred and twelve.
ADULT MENTOR: Try it. Yeah.
MENTOR AND STUDENTS: [Hearty laughter.] MENTOR:
We need a numerical procedure which is easy in one direction, and hard in the other. This brings us to modular arithmetic, also known as clock arithmetic. For example, to find 46 mod 12, we can take a rope of length 46 units, and wrap it around a clock 12 units which is called the modulist, and where the rope ends is the solution.
 Let's say that we have two parallel lines. So that's one line right over there, and then this is the other line that is parallel to the first one.
Despite the fact that Wilson had just won re-election in 1916 based on a platform of keeping the United States out of war, by april... ...by april of... ...nineteen... ...seventeen, the administration had decided that Germany had gone too far, and in particular had gone too far with the unrestricted submarine warfare so this right over here is a picture of President Wilson on april second 1917 giving a war message to Congress as to why the U.S. needs to declare war on Germany, and april fourth Congress passes the resolution to declare war, and the President approves it on april sixth, so by early april the United States was at war with Germany. Which is a good time to start thinking about why did all of this happen.
And... it also made the Americans quite angry to realize that the Germans were trying to enside the Mexicans against them, so you have the Zimmermann... you have the Zimmermann telegram the Zimmermann.. ...telegram, is also a reason that the Wilson administration and why people in general were fairly angry about things. Now on top of that there were, there were atrocities committed by the Germans in their march through Belgium as they were trying to execute on the Schlieffen plan.
So belgian.. ...belgian... ...atrocities, and these were early in the war, at nineteen forty, which immediately made many Americans kind of not like what's going on, belgian atrocities. And to put on top of that, the British were able to leverage the belgian atrocities, to fairly, to execute... uh...a fairly effective propaganda campaign uh... in America.
Austro-hungarians, these are monarchies, these are, emperors were controlling it, and even though the UK, the United Kingdom was nominally a kingdom it was really a democracy, at least for those who could vote, we're not talking about the entire British Empire.
So the UK... is functionally a democracy, ...democratic... and so was the third: French republic. ...and so was... ...and so was France.
So there's this argument that the U.S. is fighting for the represent... the representation of people. Now, there is a more cynical argument, that some people have made, and I think it's reasonable to give that due time, and one of the cynical arguments, or the more cynical arguments, is that the U.S. had close financial and trade ties to Britain, not to mention cultural ties, ...financial ties to... ...the British. On top of that you have very successful British propaganda the... one talking about the atrocities in Belgium, which did actually happen but the British were able to exploit this as a propaganda machine, ...successful propaganda, but they also spread rumors that after the sinking of the Lusitania, that the Germans had their school's children celebrating, and these were all made up, ...propaganda.
In fact in little orphan Annie Daddy Warbucks, the main reason why his last name is "Warbucks" is because he made... ...he made his fortune as a war profiteer during World War One. War profiteers these are people who might be selling arms to the Allies, or who might sell arms to the U.S. Government if the U.S. were to get into a war, that might somehow supply the troops and includes uh... potentially focus on Wall Street, there were significant lending to the Allies and mainly the Allies, not to the central power, and so the view is that the Allies win, those loans are going to be made good. And I have the entire text of the speech from... ..senator George Norris who was one of five senators, oh sorry... one of six senators to vote against the resolution to go to war, there were fifty represent... fifty representatives who also voted against it, this is a little excerpt but also in this tutorial I have the full text of the speech in a highly, highly, highly uh... recommended reading that, along with Wilson's text of his speech to Congress in his war... in his war message.
As an artist, connection is very important to me. Through my work I'm trying to articulate that humans are not separate from nature and that everything is interconnected. I first went to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, where I saw my first icebergs.
I was in awe. My heart beat fast, my head was dizzy, trying to comprehend what it was that stood in front of me. The icebergs around me were almost 200 feet out of the water, and I could only help but wonder that this was one snowflake on top of another snowflake, year after year.
Some of the ice in the icebergs that I photograph is very young -- a couple thousand years old. And some of the ice is over 100,000 years old.
The last pictures I'd like to show you are of an iceberg that I photographed in Qeqetarsuaq, Greenland.
It's a very rare occasion that you get to actually witness an iceberg rolling. So here it is. You can see on the left side a small boat.
And just like that, the iceberg shows you a different side of its personality. Thank you. (Applause)
What I want to do is to give you a broad overview of all of the wars that France was in at this time, and then talk about, in a little bit more detail, exactly what Napoleon was up to, and his role in either beginning or ending many of these wars. So, you might remember, from 1792 to 1797, you had the war of the First Coalition. And the players there were
So,he leads the troops across the Alps into Italy. Into Italy right here. And once again, this pattern is emerging.
PROBLEM: "Consider the following coordinate pairs." (And they give us a bunch right over here.)
 In this video, I'm going to do several examples of quadratic equations that are really of a special form, and it's really a bit of warm-up for the next video that we're going to do on completing the square. So let me show you what I'm talking about.
Square root of 4 times square root of 2 is the same thing as square root of 4 times the square root of 2, plus or minus the square root of 4 is that 2 right there. Now, it might look like a really bizarro equation, with this plus or minus 2 times the square of 2, but it really isn't. These are actually two numbers here, and we're actually simultaneously solving two equations.
On the right-hand side, I have-- you can't really mathematically, I mean, you could do them if you had a calculator, but I'll just leave it as negative 1 plus or minus the square root, or 2 times the square root of 2. That's what 4x is equal to. If we did it here, as two separate equations, same idea.
This negative 1 and this positive 1 cancel out, so you're left with 2 roots of 2 squared, minus 8 is equal to 0. And then what are you going to have here? So when you square this, you get 4 times 2, minus 8 is equal to 0, which is true.
And hopefully negative 5 jumps out at you. So this expression right here is x minus 5, times x minus 5. So this left-hand side can be written as x minus 5 squared, and the right-hand side is still 9.
25 minus 9 is 16, and that would be equal to 0. And here, this would be just a traditional factoring problem, the type that we've seen in the last few videos. What two numbers, when you take their product, you get positive 16, and when you sum them you get negative 10?
And maybe negative 8 and negative 2 jump into your brain. So we get x minus 8, times x minus 2 is equal to 0. And so x could be equal to 8 or x could be equal to 2.
You had to say, oh, 5 times 5 is 25, and negative 10 is negative 5 plus negative 5. So I take that back, you still have to do that little game in your head. So let's do another one.
And that means that x could be equal to-- negative 9 plus 1 is negative 8, or x could be equal to-- negative 9 minus 1, which is negative 10. And once again, you could have done this the traditional way. You could have subtracted 1 from both sides and you would have gotten x squared plus 18x, plus 80 is equal to 0.

For every 3 hours of computer games, Sandy has 2 hours of homework. For every 7 hours of computer games, Madison has 4 hours of homework. I can say they have to do a number, a certain number of homework for every amount of computer games they play.
What I want you to attempt to do is given an arbitrary list—
I made a particular example of an arbitrary list right here— write a function that sorts that arbitrary list. So maybe you call your function my_sort() You can call it whatever.
What I want is, after I call my_sort() on a list, that the list itself gets resorted. So I don't want my_sort() to return a copy of the list. I want, after I call my_sort() on "a", if I then refer to "a"—
let's say I do print(a), if I do print(a)— then that will literally return a sorted version of "a". Or I should say, it will return "a" but now "a" itself is sorted, the list that "a" is referring to is now sorted.
So it would now look like this,
"a" would now look like [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8]. And you might say, wait Sal, that's very easy.
There is already a sort function in Python. You literally can call a.sort() and that will sort "a" in place just the way I've asked you to do. And when I say in place I'm saying it's actually going to work on the actual list.
And sorting is really a good way to think about how good a function— and we'll start talking about algorithms— how good a process is or how fast a process is, or how efficient a process is at doing something.
So I'll leave you there. Try to sort this. In the next video,
I'll try my best— try at actually writing that algorithm in a python program.
First, a video.
Yes, it is a scrambled egg. But as you look at it, I hope you'll begin to feel just slightly uneasy.
Eric Beinhocker estimates that in New York City alone, there are some 10 billion SKUs, or distinct commodities, being traded.
That's hundreds of times as many species as there are on Earth. And they're being traded by a species of almost seven billion individuals, who are linked by trade, travel, and the Internet into a global system of stupendous complexity. So here's a great puzzle: in a universe ruled by the second law of thermodynamics, how is it possible to generate the sort of complexity I've described, the sort of complexity represented by you and me and the convention center?
The complex things get more fragile, more vulnerable; the Goldilocks conditions get more stringent, and it's more difficult to create complexity. Now, we, as extremely complex creatures, desperately need to know this story of how the universe creates complexity despite the second law, and why complexity means vulnerability and fragility. And that's the story that we tell in big history.
Around us, there's nothing. There's not even time or space. Imagine the darkest, emptiest thing you can and cube it a gazillion times and that's where we are.
What are the Goldilocks conditions? Well, first, you need energy, but not too much. In the center of a star, there's so much energy that any atoms that combine will just get busted apart again.
And DNA, of course, is the beautiful molecule that contains that information. You'll be familiar with the double helix of DNA. Each rung contains information.
Sixty-five million years ago, an asteroid landed on Earth near the Yucatan Peninsula, creating conditions equivalent to those of a nuclear war, and the dinosaurs were wiped out. Terrible news for the dinosaurs, but great news for our mammalian ancestors, who flourished in the niches left empty by the dinosaurs. And we human beings are part of that creative evolutionary pulse that began 65 million years ago with the landing of an asteroid.
We've seen that DNA learns in a sense, it accumulates information. But it is so slow.
DNA accumulates information through random errors, some of which just happen to work. But DNA had actually generated a faster way of learning: it had produced organisms with brains, and those organisms can learn in real time. They accumulate information, they learn.
We evolved as a species in the savanna lands of Africa, but then you see humans migrating into new environments, into desert lands, into jungles, into the Ice Age tundra of Siberia -- tough, tough environment -- into the Americas, into Australasia.
Each migration involved learning -- learning new ways of exploiting the environment, new ways of dealing with their surroundings. Then 10,000 years ago, exploiting a sudden change in global climate with the end of the last ice age, humans learned to farm.
So -- Here we are, back at the convention center. We've been on a journey, a return journey, of 13.7 billion years.
I remember very vividly as a child growing up in England, living through the Cuban Missile Crisis. For a few days, the entire biosphere seemed to be on the verge of destruction.
We're burning fossil fuels at such a rate that we seem to be undermining the Goldilocks conditions that made it possible for human civilizations to flourish over the last 10,000 years. So what big history can do is show us the nature of our complexity and fragility and the dangers that face us, but it can also show us our power with collective learning. And now, finally -- this is what I want.
We believe that big history will be a vital intellectual tool for them, as Daniel and his generation face the huge challenges and also the huge opportunities ahead of them at this threshold moment in the history of our beautiful planet. I thank you for your attention. (Applause)
Let's say that both Ben's Shoes and Jason's Shoes are publicly traded companies All that means is that both of their shares are traded on exchanges Maybe it's the Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange or some other exchange
The last closing price for Ben's stock was $21.50/share
The last closing price for Jason's stock was $12.00/share What I want to explore in this video, and probably next video, is what is that saying for what the market thinks of these businesses are worth So in both of these situations they have 10,000 shares
So if theshareholders are wiling to pay $21.50/share for Ben's stock, and there are 10,000 shares in Ben's company
So you take $21.50 times 10,000 shares gives us a market cap of $215,000
What this says is look if each of those 10,000 slices of the equities are worth $21.50 then the entire equity portion is going to be what the market is valuing it at $215,000 And this calculation, this multiplication of market price per share times the number of shares this is called the market cap Short for market capitalization the market cap of the company
And all it is, is what is market valuing the equity part of Ben's company worth
Let's do the same thing for Jason's company You have $12/share times 10,000 shares That gives us $120,000 market cap
So the market is telling us that even though on the books Ben's equity based on how he values his assets and liabilities is $135,000 The market is actually valuing this at $215,000 And in the next video we'll think about how the market is actually valuing the business
They're the share of owner's equity and not of the asset also gives you a good sense of what market cap is It's the market's value of the owner's equity And notice in both cases, and it's usually the case it's going to be a different number than the book value the number that's actually on the books

We're in the Wallace Collection in London. This is Fragonard's, "The Swing". And the first thing that I notice is this "poof" of pink and lacy white in the center of the painting.
It actually shows a little angelic figure or a putti who's actually got his finger up to his lips as if he's saying "shh", uh, keep the secret. - And we're not out in the wild here we're like behind a villa or a palace... - You can just actually make out some architecture in the distance, just under her left arm. This is a garden that's been over-grown, that's lush but it's out of control.
- And it's this kind of painting, this kind of painting that seems to be about only pleasure that Diderot and the other thinkers of the enlightenment are going to rail against and call for an art that is heroic and virtuous and appeals to the highest human aspirations and not our basest human aspirations and it's that kind of enlightenment thinking that will lead, of course, to the revolution in 1789 [music]
Jason bicycled from home to the train station at an average speed of 10 miles per hour. Then he boarded a train and traveled into the city at an average speed of 50 miles per hour. The entire distance was 30 miles; the entire trip took 1 hour.
So I have this yellow rectangle here and we know two things about this yellow rectangle. We know that it has a length of 10, that the, that the length of this side right over here is 10, and we also know that this yellow rectangle has an area of 60 square units. Whatever units we're measuring this 10 in.
Well, 10 times 6 is equal to 60. 10 times 6 is equal to 60 square units. 10 units times 6 units is equal to 60 square units.
5 plus this question mark is equal to 17. Well, 5 plus 12 is equal to 17. And you can verify this.
Well, for the area, I just have to multiply the length times the width. 8 units times 8 units is 64 square units. And what is the perimeter here?
Well, these two sides are gonna make up half the perimeter. If I wanted to figure out the whole one, I, I know this is also 8 and this is also 8.
What's the perimeter? Well it's gonna be 4 plus 15. And whatever that is times 2.
Well 10 plus 20 is 30, but I've just considered only two of the sides, two of the sides right here. That's only halfway around. So ten plus 20 is 30 times 2 is 60.
Let's give ourselves a little more practice with logarithms.
So just a little bit of review...
Let's evaluate log, base 2, of 8. What does this evaluate to? Well it's asking us it'll evaluate to the power that I have to raise our base to.
What is-- and I'll colour code it... what is log, base 8, of 2? Now this is interesting, I'll give you a few seconds to think about it. Well we're asking ourselves or this will evaluate to the exponent that I have to raise 8 to, to get to 2.
What would be the log, base 8, of one-half. What does this evaluate to? Let me clean this up so we have some space to work with.
Well the power I have to raise 8 to to get to one-half is negative one-third. I hope you enjoyed that as much as I did.
We're asked to add 4/9 and 11/12 and to write our answer as a mixed number, and then simplify and write our answer as a mixed number. So here we have two fractions we're adding together, but we have different denominators. So whenever you add fractions, the first thing you have to do is check the denominators.
9 times 4 is equal to 36. Now, you can't just multiply the denominator by 4. You also have to multiply the numerator by the same thing.
Plot the ordered pair (6, -8) into the coordinate plane. So this is the coordinate plane over here: This is the horizontal axis over here is the x axis
-3, this right here is -4
-5, -6, -7, -8 So we move to the right 6 and down 8 we move to the right 6 then we move down 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 and we are right over there so that is the point (6, -8) you can also move at it this way so you move 6 there so we will be along this line here and then you can go and then the y coordinate is -8 and you say we will be along this line over here and the place they intersect is this coordinate the way i like to think of it move 6 to the right move along the x axis and then move along in the y axis so you go down 8
This is a video about soap Soap is made by treating oils with a strong akaline solution The Babylonians already knew how to make soap almost 5000 years ago using ashes and plant oils.
Almost all substances fall into one of two types polar and nonpolar Water is a polar solvent, and anything that dissolves in water is a polar solute And many other substances such as oil are nonpolar solvents and anything that dissolves in them is a nonpolar solute.
Polar solute can only dissolve is a polar solvent
And nonpolar solute can only dissolve in a nonpolar solvent In other words, like dissolves like. Let's see what happens when we try to dissolve solute in an incorrect solvent type
For a polar solvent, I can just use some water.
For a good non-polar solvent we're gonna need some help from a chemist we're going to use hexane
Hexane is hydrocarbon with six carbon atoms.
It looks like water but it is volatile highly flammable and must be handled with care. You already saw what happened when we mixed colored salt with water. The salt dissolved in the water because salt is a polar solute and water is a polar solvent.
And as we expected the salt does not dissolve in the hexane and settles at the bottom of the beaker And now we will try the same thing but this time we will use a common non-polar solute that you often find in your frying pan, butter.
And as we suspected the butter does not dissolve in water And just like with the salt we will also test our nonpolar solute with hexane
As we suspected the butter does dissolve in the hexane So as we expected when we try to mix our solutes and solvents the salt only dissolves in water and the butter only dissolves in hexane Like dissolves like
Where we left off in the last video, we saw that things were already starting to get ugly. As early as October of 1789, we saw the Women's March, where there were these suspicions that the royals were hoarding the grain. So they marched to Versailles, and they essentially stormed Versailles, and forced the royals, forced Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette to move back to Paris.
John: Hi there, my name is John Green. This is Crash Course World History and today we're going to talk about Africa.
Mr. Green, Mr. Green!
We've already talked about Africa. Egypt is in Africa and you haven't shut up about it the entire course. Yeah that's true, me from the past but Africa's big.
let me direct your attention to Iliad and Odyssey which were composed and memorized by poets for centuries before anyone ever wrote them down. And two, no less an authority than Plato said that writing destroys human memory by alleviating the need to remember anything and three, you think the oral tradition is uncivilized but here you are listening to me talk!
We do have a lot of interesting records for some African histories including the legendary tale of Mansa Musa. By legendary I mean some of it probably isn't true but it sure is important. Let's go to the thought bubble.
So there was this king Mansa Musa who ruled the West African empire of Mali and in 1324-ish he left his home and made the hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca. He brought with him an entourage of over 1,000 people some sources say 60,000 and most importantly, 100 camel loads of gold. I wish it had been donkeys so I could say he had 100 assloads of gold but no, camels.
He built houses in Cairo and in Mecca to house his attendants and as he traveled through the world a lot of people, notably the merchants of Venice, No, thought bubble, like actual merchants of Venice.
Right, they saw him in Alexandria and returned to Italy with tales of Mansa Musa's ridiculous wealth which helped create the myth in the minds of Europeans that West Africa was a land of gold, an El Dorado. The kind of place you'd like to visit and maybe, you know, in 5 centuries or so, begin to pillage. Thanks thought bubble.
Mansa Musa knew all about the places he was going before he got there and after his visits the rest of the Mediterranean world was sure interested in finding out more about his homeland.
Mansa Musa's pilgrimage also brings up a lot of questions about West Africa namely, what did his kingdom look like and how did he come to convert to Islam?
The first question is a little easier so, we'll start with that one.
The empire of Mali, which Mansa Musa ruled until the extremely elite year of 1337 was a large swath of West Africa, running from the coast hundreds of miles into the interior and including many significant cities. The largest and best-known of which was Timbuktu. The story of the Islamization of the Empire however, is a bit more complicated.
Okay, so pastoral North Africans called Berbers had long traded with West Africans with the Berbers offering salt in exchange for West African gold. That may seem like a bad deal until you consider that without salt, we die. Whereas without gold, we only have to face the universe's depraved indifference to us without the benefit of metallic adornment.
Islam became the religion of the elites in West Africa which meant that Muslim kings were trying to extend their power over largely non-Muslim populations which worshipped traditional African gods and spirits. In order not to seem too foreign, these African Muslim kings would often blend traditional religion with Islam like for instance, giving women more equality than was seen in Islam's birthplace.
Anyway, the first kings we have a record of adopting Islam were from Ghana which was probably the first empire in West Africa. It really took off in the 11th century. As with all empires and also everything else,
Ghana rose and then fell and it was replaced by Mali.
The kings of Mali especially Mansa Musa, but also Mansa Sulayman his successor, tried to increase the knowledge and practice of Islam in their territory. For example, when Mansa Musa returned from his hajj, he brought back scholars and architects to build mosques.
The reason we know a lot about Mali is because it was visited by Ibn Battuta, the Moroccan cleric and scholar who kind of had the best life ever.
He was particularly fascinated by gender roles in the Malian empire and by Malian women writing, "They are extremely beautiful, and more important than the men." It must be the time for the open letter.
An open letter to Ibn Battuta. I wonder what's in the secret compartment today. It appears to be some kind of fake beard.
Stan, why did you do this to me? Dear Ibn Battuta, Bro, I love Twitter and my X-box and Hawaiian pizza but if I had to go into the past and live anyone's life, it would be yours.
And everywhere you went, you were treated like a king and then you went home and wrote a really famous book called the Rihla that people still read today and also you could grow a real beard and I'm jealous! Best wishes, John Green. One more thing about Mansa Musa.
The Malian Empire eventually fell to Songhai which was itself eventually overthrown for being insufficiently Islamic all of which is to say that like China or India or Europe
West Africa had its own empires that relied upon religion and war and incredibly boring dynastic politics. Man, I hate dynastic politics. If I wanted to live in an ostensibly independent country that can't let go of monarchy,
like Zanzibar and Mombasa and Mogadishu. All of which formed network of trade ports. There was no central authority.
The Swahili language is part of a language group called Bantu and its original speakers were from West Africa. Their migration to East Africa changed, not only the linguistic traditions of Africa but everything else because they brought with them ironwork and agriculture. Until then, most of the people living in the East had been hunter-gatherers or herders but once introduced, agriculture took hold as it almost always does.
Modern day Swahili, by the way, is still a Bantu-based language although it's been heavily influenced by Arabic.
On that topc, for a long time historians believed that these East African cities were all started by Arab or Persian traders which was basically just racist. They didn't believe that Africans were sophisticated enough to found these great cities. Now scholars recognize that all the major Swahili cities were founded well before Islam arrived in the region and that, in fact, trade had been going on since the first century CE.
In many of the Swahili states these Muslim communities started out quite small but at their height between the 13th and 16th century, most of the cities boasted large mosques.
The one in Kilwa even impressed Ibn Battuta who of course visited the city because he was having the best life ever. Most of the goods exported were raw materials like ivory and animal hides and timber.
Now that we know a little bit about lists,
I thought I would use this video to introduce you to loops, and, in particular, for loops (and if we have time we might do other types of loops). But before we even do that,
I want to introduce you to a built-in Python function called "range()" -- and when I say "built in," it means it comes with Python. And it's really a way to generate lists
-- lists that have integers that increment. So, for example, if I just say, range of six [range(6)] it generates a list from 0 through 5. So it's six elements, up to, but not including six.
And what's cool about these Integrated Development Environments, these I.D.E.s, this PyScripter that I'm running is that when I type in a function that it recognizes, it actually will tell me a little bit, something about that function, in case you forget it. So I don't know if you can read this here, but it says, "range([start,] stop, [step])" so you can also, if you want, tell it, how much to int--
[?] up to but not including 31. So it can generate a whole bunch of lists and the reason why this is useful is that we can use these inside of loops. And so the first type of loop
So I could say "for i" and i is this variable that's often used in "for" loops and iterative loops and iterative means you keep doing something over and over again. "for i in" and let me do a simple one, "in range," and I'm just gonna say, 5, "range(5)" So this will generate a list, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], so "for i in range(5)" and this colon says, "Now we're going to have a sub-clause of what to do on each of those iterations."
What it did is, it created a loop, so each time it goes to the loop it assigns i to a different element in this list. As you remember, this list was [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] (Did I say 0,1,2,3,4,5 before? No, it's just 0,1,2,3,4 -- up to but not including 5.)
"each time you go through the loop, why don't you..."
"add to sum, define it to be the previous sum plus what i is in this part of the loop." And just so we can keep track of it, I then want to print the sum.
We start off with this variable "sum" that is set to 0. There's two ways to visualize variables. A common way to visualize (this isn't necessarily wrong, it's sometimes an easier way to think about it) is to view them as buckets.
So, if you view them as buckets you can say, okay, from the get-go, the number in the "sum" bucket is 0. But the reality is that the variable "sum" is now referring to the numeric literal, the actual number 0, sitting in memory someplace. Now we enter into the "for" loop.
And what the for loop says is let's iteratively assign i to each of the elements in the list generated by range(10) So let's be clear, if we call this, right over here, range of 10, this will generate a list that looks like this: ... up to but not including 10, this is ten elements right over here.
I can use it anywhere -- outside the clause or inside the clause, because it was defined outside of the clause.) So you have your "i" So this, if you think of it as a bucket the first iteration is assigned to this first item over here.
And we go through the loop again; sum is now 1, 1 + i, i is now 2; 1 + 2 is 3. So sum is now going to be 3 this time through the loop. So sum is now referring to 3, you print sum, you get 3.
And you keep going all the way, i is going to keep referring to as we go through the loop, the loop will keep going as there's more things that i can refer to, that we can keep incrementing i to these other values over here. And eventually, i is going to be 9, we're going to evaluate this, and the for loop says,
"Hey, is there anything left in this list that i can be?" And you're like, "No! There isn't anything left in this list!"
We have negative 3/4 minus 7/6 minus 3/6. And there's many ways to do this. But it immediately jumps out at me that these last two numbers have a 6 in the denominator.
If you're at all like me, this is what you do with the sunny summer weekends in San Francisco: you build experimental kite-powered hydrofoils capable of more than 30 knots. And you realize that there is incredible power in the wind, and it can do amazing things. And one day, a vessel not unlike this will probably break the world speed record.
So this is of course Orville and Wilbur Wright, and the Wright Flyer. And their experiments with kites led to this momentous occasion, where we powered up and took off for the first-ever 12-second human flight. And that was fantastic for the future of commercial aviation.
And a fabulous man called Miles Loyd who lives on the outskirts of San Francisco, wrote this seminal paper that was completely ignored in the Journal of Energy about how to use basically an airplane on a piece of string to generate enormous amounts of electricity. The real key observation he made is that a free-flying wing can sweep through more sky and generate more power in a unit of time than a fixed-wing turbine. So turbines grew.
And the real significant thing here is we're developing the control systems, as did the Wright brothers, that would enable sustained, long-duration flight. And it doesn't hurt to do it in a location like this either. So this is the equivalent for a kite flier of peeing in the snow -- that's tracing your name in the sky.
If you give me a 747, I'll make six megawatts, which is more than the largest wind turbines today. And the Spruce Goose would be a 15-megawatt wing. So that is audacious, you say.
I have a secret I don't tell many people. The truth is, I'm a slacker in the health department.
And everyone seems to have contradicting advice on the best ways to be healthy, get in shape, have a living room that could be featured on Martha Stewart instead of on hoarders, (Laughter) like mine. And at this type of event, on a day like this,
The Mayo Clinic, Web MD, Dr. Oz, Government Health Organizations, even the American Heart Association states that daily consumption of one to two drinks a day can improve health and lead to a longer life.
Daily consumption of alcohol has been linked to a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, dementia, including Alzheimer's, gal stones, strokes, kidney stones, that's just to name a few. Now here's something everyone can relate to. A study on the common cold found that if you are a non-smoker, three or four drinks a day, were associated with a decreased risk for developing colds.
The second unknown dirty secret to happiness and health: gaining weight. The truth is that slim toned people are having a tough time. (Laughter)
Maya Angelou once said,
"A solitary fantasy can transform a million realities." What dream or vision do you want to turn into reality? I always wanted to go into business for myself.
At Roche Pharmaceutical, the president asked us to create a picture of his vision. Prior to having one, less than 40 percent of the employees understood the company's vision and strategy. After seeing this picture, 96 percent understood it, and 84 percent understood how what they did everyday align to that picture.
Suddenly, you have a road map for change. So what is your current state? Well, let's say you're Joe.
Joe has a good job. Joe has a lovely wife, Amy.
Joe makes good money, but like many of us, Joe wants more from life. And he'd like to get rid of a couple of things. Maybe that intense workload, maybe that negative boss.
Maybe Joe has a higher purpose; he's just not sure how to get there. So, now, Joe's current state is visual. We remember things better when they're attached to a picture.
In order for Joe to freely dream, he must first... ...trick his brain. Because the left side of your brain, as you know, houses the critic, who is forever trying to keep you safe from harm, make sure you don't do anything dangerous or stupid. So let's have Joe tell the critic that he's just going to use his imagination.
Joe has a couple of great collaborators, and Joe is just bursting with creativity and ideas, and all of those things we dream about.
Connection, and purpose, and freedom, and love.
Now I'm drawing this picture as the favor to Joe today. But in real life, he'd have to draw his own picture. Because he can't afford me.
It guesses. It guesses! And just as it can guess where your cup of coffee is when it goes to pick it up, it can correctly guess what the three bold steps are that you should take.
So how can you get yourself to do the boldest thing? By drawing the most compelling picture, so when you look here, you're in pain, it hurts. When you're here, you're ecstatic, it's fantastic, you're already living inside that connected and free life you drew.
You ask Amy, "Will you support me in my vision?" You go to your boss and you ask him for a raise. And you become that one person out of ten to make change happen.
Now, I put this template on your chairs, so that you can do for yourself what I just did for Joe. You've seen some fantastic ideas today that have inspired your dream. I dare you to draw that dream into that template.
Maya Angelou said, "A solitary fantasy can transform a million realities." Just three bold steps can transform one reality, yours. Thank you.
[This video has no audio narrations.]
I'd like to begin this song I wrote about ceaseless yearning and never-ending want with a poem of popular Petrarchan paradoxes by Sir Thomas Wyatt the Elder:
"I find no peace, and all my war is done; I fear and hope, I burn and freeze like ice; I fly above the wind, and yet I cannot arise;
♫ I want what I can't have, need what I can't want ♫ ♫ Have what I don't have, what I want ♫ ♫ What I can't have, need what I can't want ♫ ♫ Have what I don't have, what I want ♫ ♫ What I can't have, need what I can't want ♫ ♫ Have what I don't have, what I want ♫ ♫ What I can't have, need what I can't want ♫ ♫ Have what I don't have, what I want ♫ ♫ What I can't have, need what I can't want ♫ ♫ Have but I don't have ♫ ♫ It feels like all I got is loss on a bad back ♫ ♫ Gone with the last train, honey don't you fret ♫ ♫ Every cloud has a silver lining ♫ ♫ Just a little rain, just a little rain, just a little rain ♫ ♫ I want what I can't have, need what I can't want ♫ ♫ Have what I don't have, what I want ♫ ♫ What I can't have, need what I can't want ♫ ♫ Have but I don't have ♫ ♫ My mind won't stop, and my heart says go ♫ ♫ Nobody knows how to hold me ♫ ♫ My mind won't stop, and my heart says, ♫ ♫ "Good things come to those who wait" ♫ ♫ And I can't stand in ... ♫ ♫ I can't stand in line forever ♫ ♫ Stand the cold air ♫ ♫ Glad-handed ♫ ♫ Sick and tired of the "Later, maybe" ♫ ♫ Take it, fake it, take it, take-it-or-leave-it life ♫ ♫ And I gotta just tame it ♫ ♫ I gotta just name it ♫ ♫ I gotta just seize, so please, oh please, oh please, oh please ♫ ♫ Oh please me right, 'cause ♫ ♫ My mind won't stop ♫ ♫ And my heart says go ♫ ♫ Nobody knows how to hold me ♫ ♫ My mind won't stop -- and my heart says go-ooooo ... ♫

Let's see if we can simplify 5 times the square root of 117. So 117 doesn't jump out at me as some type of a perfect square. So let's actually take its prime factorization and see if any of those prime factors show up more than once.
It's clearly not divisible by 2. To test whether it's divisible by 3, we can add up all of the digits. And we explain why this works in another place on Khan Academy.
Now 39, we can factor as-- that jumps out more at us that that's divisible by 3. That's equivalent to 3 times 13. And then all of these are now prime numbers.
I have talked a bunch about the Drake equation or our own version of the drake equation that starts with the number of stars in the galaxy.
But I haven't given it a shot yet I haven't tried my own attempt at thinking about how many detectable civilizations there are So lets actually do that here so lets just assume there are one hundred billion stars so that's my first term right over there
In the last video, we talk about how seasons on Earth are not caused by how close Earth is to the Sun, its orbit. We also hint at the fact that it's actually caused by the tilt of the Earth. And so, in this video, I wanna show you how the tilt of the Earth causes the seasons to happen.
[This video has no audio narration.]
A month ago today I stood there:
90 degrees south, the top of the bottom of the world, the Geographic South Pole. And I stood there beside two very good friends of mine,
Richard Weber and Kevin Vallely. Together we had just broken the world speed record for a trek to the South Pole. It took us 33 days, 23 hours and 55 minutes to get there.
And in the process, I became the first person in history to make the entire 650-mile journey, from Hercules Inlet to South Pole, solely on feet, without skis. Now, many of you are probably saying, "Wait a sec, is this tough to do?" (Laughter)
Peter Thum, who inspired me with his actions. He's trying to find and solve water issues, the crisis around the world. His dedication inspired me to come up with this expedition: a run to the South Pole where, with an interactive website,
Young people in northern Canada, kids in an elementary school, dragging sleds across the school-yard, pretending they were Richard, Ray and Kevin. Amazing. We arrived at the South Pole.
In the last video, we were able to calculate the real return by putting everything in today's dollars.
In the last couple of videos we figured out the electron configurations for atoms that only had electrons in the S and P subshells. and so we have this obvious problem we also have the D subshell which we'll talk about here with these bizarre shapes
And eventually we even get into the F subshells which are these really kinda exotic looking shapes and these shapes they're interesting to look at and think about. but they're not as important for actually figuring out the configuration. so the question arises what happens when we start going to the D and F subshells.
The general way to think about it is the energy shell you're in is equivelant to the period, we are in the periodic table so if we were to do... so just it all fits on one page... the periods would appear here on the left but then I wouldn't be able to finish the whole table So this is period one let me write this in a darker color.
Period one, two, three, four, five, six
I think I barely am fitting on the page. So each row is a period and then for the porposes of figuring out the electron configuration we did this in the last video we want to put helium let me just copy and paste exactly helium we want to put Helium in the S block so we want to put Helium right there the reason why, just in case you are curios of why Helium is put there in the periodic table is because it has very similar properties to the other elements in this columns or this group each column is called a group and we'll talk about valence electrons and why that leads to different properties but for electron configuration purposes we can put it in the S block and that's not too hard to remember beacuse it's just one element and it kind of makes sense，1s1, 1s2, etc.
All you do is draw blocks around them so, see, this is - I said multiple times already that this is - this right here is the S block this over here on the right is the P block that's the P block
And then this in the middle right here is the D block. this is the D block. and so if you want to figure out the electron configuration of any atom you just have to... the way you think about it.. they fill in this order, but when you say.. Let's say this, this, you know when you go from Calcium: Clacium would have filled out the 4s2 right?
4s1, 4s2, so if I just do it's 4th energy shell it looks like this. Calcium is:
4s2.. and the you start filling the D block, right? Oh, what did I say? I wanted to do... so that's Calcium instead I wanted to write the electron configuration for iron which is in the D block so turns out and this is kind of an artifact and I'll do a more detailed video on this in the future that it actually goes and backfills the 3rd energy shell because all of the sudden the D orbitals can kind of fit in the gaps of the 3rd energy shell so what you do is you go one energy shell above it
So whatever period you are in in the d block you go one minus that.
Sorry, you go that period minus one to figure out what energy shell the D block is filling so iron has 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 elements in the D block. so it's going to have d6, but it's not going to do 4d6. It's going to be 3d6 And I figured that out because it's in the fourth period and I subtracted one from that. so this is kind of the highest energy 8 electrons in iron.
I would say that there are two electrons in the outer-most energy shell for iron. But if I were to say which energy shell has the highest energy electrons? It would be these.
Let me actually do the whole electron configuration for... let me pick up another one... let me take, this is Copper right here.
let me do the whole thing for iron. Sorry to be waffling around so much.
If you want to do the entire electron configuration for iron it would be 1s2. That's the first energy shell now the second, let me do that in magenta, right there.
Valence Electrons. This iron has 2 valence electrons, because the outer shell is 4s2. Even though it had these... even after filling 4s2 it had 6 more electrons. but those kind of backfilled the third energy shell so that's one way, and than you might say: oh well what happens when we go to the F shell?
Or the F block? So that's these down here..
In a lot of periodic tables you see these Lanthanoids and Actinoids down here and they are supposed to fill in the gap right here and that might be a little hard to visualize and I'll show you why they do this. You could just as easily made a periodic table that looks like this. where you insert them in, you push everything to the right and you insert these in but obviously this kind of periodic table is a lot harder to fit in you could have done the same thing with the D block actually This one is the S block, this is the F block and this is the D block and then this is the P block right here. when we are dealing with the F block, so let's say we wanted to figure out..
And then if you were to keep going back you would then go to 5p6 so then it would be 5p6 and then it would fill out these 10 in the D block right there that are in the 5th period but remember you subtract one from the D block so it'd be 4d10 and then it's 5s2 and you just keep going back that way, and it seems complicated at first but just remember when you are in the S or the P block you just look at the period you are in but then when you start filling the D block it fills in a subshell that's one lower and when you start fillng the F block which are these really large elements you start fillng a subshell that is two lower so maybe in the next video I'll do a couple of these electron configurations because I think I'm already out of time and I'll actually show another way to figure this out that's often covered in some chemistry classes.
See you soon.
Let's do a little bit of probability with playing cards For the sake of this video we're going to assume that our deck has no jokers in it. You could do the same problems with the joker, you'll just get slightly different numbers.
Let's first just think about how many cards we have in a standard playing deck? so you have four suits and the suits are: the spades, the diamonds, the clubs and the hearts.
You have four suits and then in each of those suits you have thirteen different types of cards or sometimes it's called the rank. So each suit has thirteen types of cards You have the ace, then you have the two, the three, the four, the five, the six, seven, eight, nine, ten and then you have the jack, the king and the queen.
Well, I can pick anyone of those 52 cards, so there's 52 possibilities for when I pick that card. And how many of those 52 possibilities are jacks? Well, you have the jack of spades, the jack of diamonds the jack of clubs and the jack of hearts.
And the intersection, where they overlap is C the combined area is going to be A plus B minus where they overlap minus C. So that's the same thing over here. We're counting all the jacks and that includes the jack of hearts we're counting all the hearts and that includes the jack of hearts.
So we counted the jack of hearts twice, so we have to subtract one out of that. So it's going to be four plus thirteen minus one. And both of those things are divisible by four.
Use the commutative law of addition-- let me underline that-- the commutative law of addition to write the expression 5 plus 8 plus 5 in a different way and then find the sum. Now, this commutative law of addition sounds like a very fancy thing, but all it means is if you're just adding a bunch of numbers, it doesn't matter what order you add the numbers in. So we could add it as 5 plus 8 plus 5.
This right here is a fresco by Raphael of Plato hanging out with his best student Aristotle And you may or may not know that these two fellows along with Plato's teacher Socrates are considered the fathers of Western philosophy, but that's not what this video is about. This is actually just a small little video about different dates or better different ways to specify dates or dating machinisms.
BC literally stands for Before Christ so the date is written 428 BC. The implication is that this is 428 years before the birth of Christ. We'll see in a second that that's not exactly right but that's what the implication is.
Which literally means -- Anno means year and Domini means Lord or the Lord or the year of our Lord and one anno domini 1 AD would be the year of Jesus Christ's birth so not after death, it stands for Anno Domini but literally Year of our Lord, so year since that Jesus was born.
CE stands for Common Era. Once again, 1 CE is the same thing as AD 1, sometimes, we now write AD 1492 or we write 1492 AD, all referrig to the exact same thing. Now, all of these things refer to... you know, when we say 428 BC it implies 428 years before the birth of Christ, 1492 AD that's in the Year of our Lord 1492 and it implies 1492 years since the birth of Christ, but the reality is that we're not really quite sure when Christ was born and so these aren't exactly.
BCE is Before the Common Era. And they put his death at 30-36 AD which is 30-36 in the Year of our Lord, that's what this stands for, Anno Domini, or in the Common Era, CE. Now, some people they obviously don't like the BC/AD naming mechanism because it's explicitly referring to Christ and every year it makes Christ the central figure in all of history, so they'll say this is clearly too Christian and they would prefer the less Christian naming scheme where we use BCE and CE.
But lot of people would still say: hey look, ok, you changed... or, you know first of all some Christians wouldn't like this that you removed the direct references to the birth of Christ or being the years since Christ's birth, but even here some people would complain that althought you've removed the direct reference that this is saying Before the Common Era and the Common Era, even though you've removed the direct reference, it still makes Christ's birth the central thing in all of history. But this is the convention whether people like it or not in order to have the same reference point and theologically it's difficult to switch it, this time, every one has essentially settled on this. So it's really just a matter of letters, which naming scheme you pick.
Viscosity is the thickness of any fluid and in paint high viscosity or viscas paint comes straight out of the tube in fact it has the consistency of a toothpaste, as you can see.
Let's add four elevenths to nine over thirteen
Narrator: We've talked a lot about aggregate demand over the last few videos, so in this video, I thought I would talk a little bit about aggregate supply. In particular, we're going to think about aggregate supply in the long-run.
There's frictions, people have to look for jobs, some people have to retrain to get their skills, but maybe we improve that in some way so that there's some website where people can find jobs easier, or easier ways to train for jobs, and the natural level of unemployment goes down, more people can produce, that would also shift this curve to the right. You could have a reality where there's technological improvements that would also, and then all of a sudden, on an average, people would become more productive; that could shift things to the right. You could have discovery of natural resources, new land that is super fertile, and everything else; that could also shift things to the right.
Let's talk a little bit more about reserve ratio requirements And then if I have time, I want to introduce another, almost related and often confused topic and that is "leverage." So let's do reserve ratio requirement.
- or have to be at least 10% of that. So right now I only have 100. Oops...
Deposits. So we can do a little bit of math. Let's see.
Well, I could keep making loans until I have 3,000 gold pieces of demand deposits. Let me start making loans out. So someone has a project where, say, 900 gold pieces they need to build a factory of some kind.
Of course they're going to use this, maybe to write checks to their laborers or their contractors, - whoever needs to build a factory. And so let's see how much do I have outstanding right now in terms of demand deposits?
2,000 loan. And then instead of giving them actual gold, I'll just create a checking account for them.
2,000 plus 900 plus 100. I have 300 in total demand deposits. And actually all of my liabilities at this point are demand deposits.
Liquid means when someone actually asks for their gold, I have the gold to give it to them. Now a separate question is, am I solvent?
Solvent means, am I good for the money? And solvent is just an issue of, are your assets larger than your liabilities? So right now in this world, my assets are what?
So anyway, I just wanted to show you that difference between liquidity and solvency. And actually, I realize that I almost used up all my time. So in the next video,
And leverage and leverage requirements have a lot more to do with solvency than liquidity. And just to give you a little bit of a preview, it essentially says, how much of a cushion do you need to have, before you're insolvent - - before your liabilities are greater than your assets?
Gina had 2/3 cup of laundry detergent. She used 1/2 of the detergent on Friday to wash all of her sheets. How much detergent does she have left?
What I want to do in this video is a fairly straightforward primer on perimeter and area. And I'll do perimeter here on the left, and I'll do area here on the right. And you're probably pretty familiar with these concepts, but we'll revisit it just in case you are not.
And let's say we know the following. And we know that AB is equal to 7, and we know that BC is equal to 5.
And we want to know, what is the perimeter of ABCD? So let me write it down. The perimeter of rectangle ABCD is just going to be equal to the sum of the lengths of the sides.
Well, we already know that's 7 in this color. So it's that side right over there is of length 7. So it'll be 7 plus this length over here, which is going to be 5.
They tell us that. BC is 5. Plus 5.
And then finally, DA a or AD, however you want to call it, is going to be the same length as BC, which is 5 again. So plus 5 again. So you have 7 plus 5 is 12 plus 7 plus 5 is 12 again.
If AB is x, then BC is x, then DC is x, and AD is x.
So if we want to figure out the perimeter here, it'll just be x plus x plus x plus x, or 4x. Let me write that. x plus x plus x plus x, which is equal to 4x, which is going to be equal to 36. They gave us that in the problem.
I'm thinking about getting a life insurance because I have a mortgage, and I have a young son and another baby on the way. So if anything were to happen to me I want them to at least be able to pay off the mortgage, and then maybe have some money left over for college and to live and whatever else. and so I went to the insurance company and said that I want to get a 1 million dollar policy.
On your math quiz, you earn five points for each question that you answer correctly in the table below, x represents the number of questions you answer correctly and y represents the total number of points that you score on your quiz fair enough? The relationship between these two variables can be expressed by the following equation y = 5x Graph the equation below
 We have the equation 20 minus 7 times x is equal to 6 times x minus 6. And we need to solve for x.
But then I have a negative 6 minus 20.
So if I'm already 6 below 0 on the number line, and I go another 20 below that, that's at negative 26. Now, the next thing we want to do is we want to get all the x terms on the left-hand side. So we don't want this 6x here, so maybe we subtract 6x from both sides.
The left-hand side, negative 7x minus 6x, that's negative 13x.
Negative 7 of something minus another 6 of that something is going to be negative 13 of that something.
And that is going to be equal to 6x minus 6x. That cancels out. That was the whole point by subtracting negative 6x.
And then we have just a negative 26, or minus 26, depending on how you want to view it, so negative 13x is equal to negative 26.
Now, our whole goal, just to remember, is to isolate the x. We have a negative 13 times the x here. So the best way to isolate it is if we have something times x, if we divide by that something, we'll isolate the x.
So we're going to have to divide both sides of the equation by negative 13. Now, what does the left-hand side become? Negative 13 times x divided by negative 13, that's just going to be x.
Well, that's just positive 2, right? A negative divided by a negative is a positive. 26 divided by 13 is 2.
What I wanna do in this video is give an introduction to the language Or some of the characters that we use when we talk about geometry and I guess the best place to start is even think about what geometry means As you might recognize the first part of geometry right over here
The same word that you see in things like Geography and Geology And this comes this refers to the earth This refers
I think it's important [that] people look at art, because we live in a visual world. And understanding, and looking at, and thinking about the way images communicate - in all kinds of ways - is important to being alive today. If one has heightened visual acumen - which you get from spending time looking at things - whether it's looking at newspaper photos closely or looking at works in a museum or looking at your surroundings - or birds - more closely, that sort of attention to an environment makes you a better person.
Lets say i run some type of sheep farm or some type of wool producing business and in year one i go out there and buy a bunch of sheep and i put them on some land and i go and buy the sheep for one million dollars and i buy the land for 1.2 million dollars so we have 2.2 million dollars in assets.
Nothing confusing there .Now lets go to year two and think about how we want to account for the sheep and the land so one way we could say this the sheep are still there the land is still there i paid a million dollars for the sheep and they are all still there so ill put on my books that the sheep are still one million dollars and i paid 1.2 million dollars for the land so ill put on my books that the landis one .two million dollars so in this situation i have accounted for the sheep and the land based on their historical cost, so let me write this down this is based on historical cost .Now another and this is a legitimate way to account for things especially if theres no other way to really think about what my sheep or my land are worth .Look this is what i paid for them now lets say there is an active market in sheep and you can get a sheep apraiser to come over to your farm to come and tell you how much you sheep are worth andyour sheep appriaser comes and says wow your sheep are looking good but theresbeen a big, id dont know,sheep epidemic in another part of the country so there's a sheep shortage so your sheep are actually worth a lot more that they were last year and they say i think you sheep are now worth 2 million dollars .so you say Hey wow! the market value of my sheep is two million so you could say instead of putting one million there let me put two million dollars for my sheep and lets say the land is also appreciated the highways gone by and someone wants to build a development nearby so theres the fair value of you land is also going up maybe its also two million dollars. so both of theses so this is two million and this is two mililion so this right over here you could view the market value or the fair value of your sheep. Now either one of these is legititmate ways of accounting but its good to know the difference
 Find the probability of rolling even numbers three times using a six-sided die numbered from 1 to 6. So let's just figure out the probability of rolling it each of the times.
After one of the previous banking videos, I got a comment: "If everyone puts gold in the banks, what can they use to transact, or to buy food, or to pay for services, et cetera?" And that is an excellent segue into the notion of a bank note. bank note...
You've probably heard the word before, maybe in some Charles Dickens' novel or something, but we're going to find out in this video it's actually a much more familiar concept than you ever realized and you probably have some of these bank notes in your wallet as we speak. Let's go back to our example. I have the Bank of Sal.
It has a nice picture of Sal in the middle, because it's the Bank of Sal, and it is denominated as one gold piece. And now you gave me that gold piece and you get this green piece of paper that only I can print and no one else has the sophistication to do something this fancy. Maybe I use some colors here and I sign it Sal and I do all sorts of stuff that makes it really hard to forge so that no one else can-- I put some holograms on it.
Anyone who holds this piece of paper can go back to the Bank of Sal and get back a gold piece. Then since everyone in the village, they trust that the Bank of Sal will always be willing to exchange one of these slips of paper for a gold piece, instead of using a gold piece to buy something, why don't you just this slip of paper? And even more, for one gold piece, you don't want to just have a stack of one gold piece pieces of paper around.
So it's 500... to kick the idea And now this is super useful. Now my bank-- we've done all of the other things, how the bank increases the money supply, and fractional lending, and how the money supply adjusts for the total production and wealth creation in the economy, but now we've found another useful thing that a bank can do, is that besides securing your gold, it's actually providing a unit of exchange that's frankly a lot easier to deal with than gold.
So one bank note might look like that and have Bank of Sal. Another bank note might have Bank of
-- I don't know-- Bank of George Bush or something, and people would kind of have to have exchanges between them to realize which banks are good for what. Now we're not as familiar with the term bank note because we only see one type, or at least one type per country. We only see bank notes from one bank, or at least one bank has the right to issue them within the United States and that's the Federal Reserve Bank.
It's actually backed by U.S. Treasuries, and I'll go into that a little later on. Actually, that's a whole fascinating realm of thought. But I just wanted to get this point home, that all you have-- that this bank actually has this other service of issuing these bank notes that are different than the checking deposits, which I will cover in the next video.
W: Hey Amin! M:
So, we can represent the atom as a block whose nucleus is the base and electrons are the bumps.
M: Okay. So the blocks are atoms.
The electrons are shared within the atoms, and the sharing of electrons is called a 'bond'. You can bond the blocks together, with different number of bumps. And the more bumps we use, the stronger the bond.
There are different bond strength depending on how many electrons they share. M:
Awesome. Bonding is fun. So is this still called an atom?
So I was trained to become a gymnast for two years in Hunan, China in the 1970s. When I was in the first grade, the government wanted to transfer me to a school for athletes, all expenses paid. But my tiger mother said, "No."
"The Good Earth" is about Chinese peasant life. That's just not convenient for propaganda. Got it.
"You shall honor your father and mother."
"Honor," I said.
"That's so different, and better, than obey." So it becomes my tool to climb out of this Confucian guilt trap and to restart my relationship with my parents. Encountering a new culture also started my habit of comparative reading.
["Lamb" by Chrisopher Moore] -- or similar stories from different cultures, as Joseph Campbell did in his wonderful book.["The Power of Myth" by Joseph Campbell] For example, both the Christ and the Buddha went through three temptations. For the Christ, the temptations are economic, political and spiritual.

We're going to go on a dive to the deep sea, and anyone that's had that lovely opportunity knows that for about two and half hours on the way down, it's a perfectly positively pitch-black world. And we used to see the most mysterious animals out the window that you couldn't describe: these blinking lights -- a world of bioluminescence, like fireflies.
Dr. Edith Widder -- she's now at the Ocean Research and Conservation Association -- was able to come up with a camera that could capture some of these incredible animals, and that's what you're seeing here on the screen.
That's all bioluminescence. Like I said: just like fireflies. There's a flying turkey under a tree.
Cephalopods -- head-foots. As a kid I knew them as calamari, mostly. (Laughter)
This is the work of Dr. Roger Hanlon at the Marine Biological Lab, and it's just fascinating how cephalopods can, with their incredible eyes, sense their surroundings, look at light, look at patterns. Here's an octopus moving across the reef, finds a spot to settle down, curls up and then disappears into the background.
Let's divide 500 and 18 by 0.7. So we're dividing this whole number by a decimal. So we can also write this as 518 divided by.
We're asked to use the drop-downs to form a linear equation with no solutions. So a linear equation with no solutions is going to be one where I don't care how you manipulate it, the thing on the left can never be equal to the thing on the right. And so let's see what options they give us.
Write 15:25 as a fraction in simplest form. So 15 to 25 is just a ratio, and we can write it. So they've given us 15 to 25.
So, the big question is: What is this? What does it do?
Simplify x to the third, and then that raised to the 4th power times x squared, and then that raised to the 5th power Here we'll use the power property of exponents, sometimes called the power rule. And that just tells us if I have x to the a and then I raise that to the bth power, this is the same as x to the a times b power.
Zach: My name is Zach Kaplan. I'm the CEO of Inventables, an online hardware store for designers.
I built everything from LEGOs to Construx to you name it. If there was a construction toy out there, I had it. At my high school, they had a team-taught class called [Sci Tech], and so this was like high school engineering.
It was Jim Howie, who was the shop teacher, and Jeff Jordan, who was the physics teacher. Those guys had vision. They were way ahead of the Maker Revolution, so to speak. they saw that abstract or the analytical things like physics needed to be combined with the practical "let's make it".
 We're asked to simplify d times 4d to the 1/2 power. So let's see what we can do here.
 Janelle is training for a road race. Her pedometer tracks how far she runs every day.
It's less than 5.
And 3.35, let's make that 3 miles, because 3 is less than 5, so we'd round down.
So that is 3 miles. And if we were to add them up, 4 plus 5 is 9. 9 plus 10 is 19.
Let me scroll down a little bit. So we're going to have to add 3.89 to 5.1-- and remember, when you're adding decimals, you want to line up the decimal-- 10.21 and then finally 3.35. And let's add all of these up.
We know the US is running a relatively large deficit relative to China in 2009 We imported 260 billion more than we exported to China and we know from the last two videos that the way, the way the China is keeping their currency from appreciating because of this trade imbalance is that they are going out there printing money and using that Yuan to buy Dollar assets And we see over here in (2006), (2007), (2008) major increase in US assets.
You see the United Kingdom. Their holdings have grown from 155 billion to 500 billion over the course of 2010 and this is relative.
United Kingdom does not have a significant trade imbalance one way or the other with the United States and we actually see, we actually see that its currency really didn't change much over the course of 2010. It's been about, it's been about the same and this looks more dramatic than it really is. So the answer and it could be much more complicated, and this is that China has decided to somewhat diversify from buying US treasuries, and in particular US assets and maybe they are diversifying to the pound sterling maybe they are diversifying to the Euro and so they'll start buying, they'll start buying, say, British assets.
The government is monitoring private phone calls your children and my children's private phone calls and tracking who their associates are.
This June we learned that out private lives are no longer private. The US government is secretly tracking the emails purchases, text messages, location and phone calls of people all over the world.
Ed Rooney, Ed? This is George Peterson... With code names like PRlSM and XKEYSCORE, this network of monitoring programs is just one part of largest surveillance system in history.
So in the last video I hopefully proved to you, at least maybe it doesn't make intuitive sense just yet, but I showed you that the probability of a and b is equal to the probability of a given b times the probability of b. And the probability of b given a is equal to the probability of b given a times a.
The probability that I got 5 out of 5 heads, given the two-sided coin times the probability of the two-sided coin-- b-- we defined event b as the two-sided coin. Time the probability of two-sided coin. Divided by the probability of in general, the probability of getting 5 out of 5 heads.
So if I want to know what's the probability of the two-sided coin, all Bayes' theorem is saying, well, OK, we observed that we got the two-sided coin. Sorry, we observed that we got 5 out of 5 heads. So we now know that we're in this yellow universe because the yellow universe represents the area or all of the outcomes where we got 5 out of 5 heads.
 Find the slope of the line in the graph. And just as a bit of a review, slope is just telling us how steep a line is.
In this video, I want to do a couple more word problems dealing with graphs of lines. So here we have a gym is offering a deal to new members. Customers can sign up by paying a registration fee of $200 and then a monthly fee of $39.
So if you went all the way out to 12, you would have to plot 668 someplace here on our line, if we just kept going out there. Let's do one more of these. Bobby and Petra are running a lemonade stand and they charge $0.45 for each glass of lemonade.
Let's think about what it means to multiply 2 over 3, or 2/3, times 4/5. In a previous video, we've already seen how we can actually compute this. This is going to be equal to-- in the numerator, we just multiply the numerators.
Growing up in Taiwan as the daughter of a calligrapher, one of my most treasured memories was my mother showing me the beauty, the shape and the form of Chinese characters. Ever since then, I was fascinated by this incredible language. But to an outsider, it seems to be as impenetrable as the Great Wall of China.
If the shape of the fire is a person with two arms on both sides, as if she was yelling frantically, "Help! I'm on fire!" --
As the old saying goes, two is company, three is a crowd.
If a person stretched their arms wide, this person is saying, "It was this big." The person inside the mouth, the person is trapped. He's a prisoner, just like Jonah inside the whale.
Remember fire? Two fires together, I get really hot. Three fires together, that's a lot of flames.
Put the sun and the moon shining together, it's brightness. It also means tomorrow, after a day and a night. The sun is coming up above the horizon.
This person is sneaking out of a door, escaping, evading. On the left, we have a woman. Two women together, they have an argument.
What I'm going to do in this video is attempt to create an implementation of the insertion sort algorithm that we talked about in the last video. I'll do it as a Python function. So I'll call the Python function insertion_sort() and it will take in a list— so list is its parameter in the function definition— so we'll have to pass in a list as an argument.
We could start at the leftmost slot in the list.
So, we could just say "len()"—
"len" just means—it's short for "length"— so length of the list.
So what this would do (is) this would start index— so let's say the list has four elements in it— then "len(list)", this right here, would be 4, would evaluate to 4. "range(4)" would produce a list that has elements [0,1,2,3] in it.
And so, index would be able to step through the different indices for this list right over here. And we could do it that way, but you might remember from the previous video that when you're doing the insertion sort it doesn't actually make sense to start at the very leftmost element.
Because there's nothing to compare it to the left.
So we can actually just start at the second to the leftmost element.
And the leftmost element is the 0th item, so we can start at the first item. So now, if the list has a length of 4, this right here will produce [1,2,3]. So, 1 would be the second to the leftmost element.
So "value" is just the item in the list at each of those indexes that we're now going to compare to all of the items to the left of it.
And what I want to do is— compare a value—I want to compare a value to each item to the left of it. So let's define a variable "i" and let's let this be the index of the things that I want to compare value to. And right from the get-go
So this is the index of the item that is directly left to it. But we're going to keep taking "i" lower and lower. So we can keep comparing value to things further and further to the left.
And so what we want to do is we're going to— we want to keep comparing further and further left until "i" has gotten all the way to the beginning of the list. And "i" has gotten all the way to the beginning of the list when it is equal to 0. So what we want to do is, we want to perform this while "i" is greater than or equal to 0.
Because if we keep taking "i" lower and lower and lower, we're going further and further to the left of the list. We don't want to try to perform it when "i" is—you know—further—is a negative number— that'll just start doing crazy things. So while "i" is greater than or equal to 0— what I'm going to do is
I'm going to keep pushing "i" further and further to the left. So let's try it this way, so the first thing I want to do— we've already pushed it to the left once. So let's compare— so if "value" is less than the— this thing keeps syntax error because (of) waiting for me to keep typing— if "value" is less than the item that is now at index "i".
We're comparing "value" to the thing to the left of it. If it's less than it, then whatever number was in that box/slot to the left of it, shift it to the right, and then shift "value" to the left. And now let's compare value to something one lower than that.
Let me save it, insertion_sort, and let me run it. Alright, so I didn't have any, at least, syntax mistakes. Syntax just means the actual characters I used—
But let's see if it actually works. So let me define "a" list. Let's say [7,1,3,5,9,2] and let me put another 3 in there.
We asked 50 rights advocates how they turn information into action and we asked what info-activism means to them Info-activism means having access to technology and being able to use technology to create and disseminate information in a very democratic and participatory way Giving people information helps them make informed decisions helps them mobilise and motivate their communities and it also means helping to raise hope in circumstances where that's the last thing that you actually feel you have
And it's about making use of all these new spaces to do you know, to do old fashioned activism engagement creativity interaction mobilisation connecting people participatory accessible inspired sharing co-operation action change 10 tactics for turning information into action a film by
Tactical Technology Collective Information is power. It can raise awareness, improve lives uncover corruption and rights abuses and when used effectively within a campaign bring about equality and justice.
We train communities in making videos and in one of the areas where we train communities they made a film on land rights in a very feudal part of Gujurat and all the videos actually end with a call to action. So the call to action in this video was to stand up for their rights and ask for the land. Video is a good tool because I think a lot of communities do not have literacy and access to other forms of technology, for instance the internet.
Rebecca Saabe Saade uses Facebook in her work with lesbian, bisexual and transgender women in Lebanon.
Because facebook is so popular in Lebanon it allows the organisations Rebecca works for to connect with a large number of people struggling with discrimination and social pressures. But using popular social network sites like Facebook has disadvantages as well. When I was working with marginalised society it was different because mainly the pressure is social so just by being out it's a problem.
It's just to help these women or whoever is looking for support for lesbians in Lebanon to just get to our website. It's linked to our website.
I mean we have profiles in different places but this is the point.
The point is to always advertise in a very popular way to get them to our website. Working with a very marginalised community that I work with we were aware that Facebook is not private at all.
No matter what you try to do it can not be private. So if we start a group, for example, and a lot of girls join that group, it will be very clear that these girls are lesbians, most probably.
So what we had to do was find a very inventive way of not connecting anyone to us.
The Pink Chaddi campaign in India also revealed pros and cons of using Facebook.
'Chaddi' means 'underwear' in Hindi
The Pink Chaddi campaign was developed as a response to women being attacked by a right wing political group called Sri Ram Sena simply because they were seen drinking in pubs.
The Pink Chaddi group mobilised 16,000 people to join the campaign within just three days and it peaked a few months later with over 50,000 members. "In a shocking incident of moral policing... hoodlums viciously attacked girls who were at a pub..." A lot of the images of this attack were broadcast on television across the country and a lot women and other people got very angry at how women were being treated by the Ram Sena.
The Pink Chaddi campaign has definitely been successful in my opinion because it has allowed for a space in which a conversation has happened between ordinary people and the Hindu right which is not always possible. It's a non violent response and it's not about beating up people who were involved in the campaign which is very often what happens -- that there is a violent response. There were various problems with the online activism which made it difficult to translate into an offline mode and one of them was the fact that it was on Facebook.
And Facebook stops you from messaging the people in your group after you hit 5,000 members. So without realising when we crossed that mark and became 16,000 and 40,000 we realised we could not communicate with anybody who was in the group anymore.
All that could be done was discussion boards and messages on the wall which were not effective enough to communicate with everyone.
Later, the Pink Chaddi campaigners learnt that using Facebook had other disadvantages as well. The groups online presence was hacked into, defaced and later deleted while offensive messages were sent to the group's creators.
Despite numerous requests on Facebook to re-establish the group months later, no action had been taken. These examples highlight the need to be alert to both the opportunities and risks involved in using online platforms for activism. As media recording devices have become smaller and cheaper people have started to record rights abuses, as they happen.
They pushed the government to arrest those agents and they pushed the government actually to use the same technique and hide cameras in the street and monitor police agents by using the same technique as was used by the Targuist Sniper. In a different context in Burma citizens' documentation of state abuses does not appear to have changed the behaviour of its military regime. However, bloggers have recorded and broadcast what they have witnessed putting a global spotlight on Burma and this has raised awareness about the human rights abuses that are taking place.
I think animation would be particularly good as a info-activism tool in advocacy in a situation where there's an explosive or sensitive political context where you don't necessarily want to handle things in a literal way or in a head-on way when you're dealing with, for example, race or gender sensitivities because you can use animals or objects, for example, in animation rather than real people.
I think the magic of animation appeals to everyone. Moving inanimate objects or objects you don't expect to move is quite amazing and it's something that excites most people.
I'm currently working on a project in Cairo with a group called The Women and Memory Forum who are re-writing Arabic mythology or folk tales from a feminist perspective We're producing a three minute animation based on one of those re-writes in order to have different cultural representations of women in the Middle East. Maps are another way to visualise information.
During the 2006 Israeli invasion of Lebanon human rights NGO, Samidoun used maps to help people understand what was happening. We did a couple of maps during the summer of 2006 at the time of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon. The two main maps, one detailed the daily bombings on Lebanon every day and it was updated daily.
Anyone who tries to look at the Tunisian Presidential Palace using Google maps, is likely to find some unexpected information thanks to the work of Tunisian activists involved with the independent collective blog site, Nawaat.org
There is a very creative experience that we've seen on the Tunisian internet when activists from Nawaat geo-tagged their videos on YouTube.
By geo-tagging I mean giving geographical information or the name of the place of the video you are publishing on YouTube.
By doing that you are making your information, your video available and watchable on the mapping tools of Google. So what the Tunisian activists did is they geo-tagged all the videos about human rights abuses in Tunisia by putting them around the Tunisian Presidential Palace in Carthage So when you go to Google Earth and you go to the Presidential Palace you will find it surrounded by videos talking about human rights abuses in Tunisia
Maps and animation are two of many tools that can be used to help people navigate and interpret information in a visual way, that will engage them and embed pictures in their minds that are likely to resonate over time. It is easy to get lost in the big picture of human rights abuses. Bringing people's personal stories to the front of your info-activism is one way to make sure people's experiences are not ignored.
Blogs are renowned for their ability to blur the lines between personal and public dialogue which makes them an effective storytelling tool.
The collaborative blog project, Blank Noise allows people to support an ongoing discussion about sexual harassment in India.
They invite bloggers to talk about their experiences of urban sexual harassment. But they do in a way where, well in the year that I participated they asked us to talk about it as if we were superheroes. So it's a very interesting take on urban sexual harassment.
Blogs, documentary videos and online stories are three ways that personal stories can be used to ensure that people's experiences reach different audiences and bring about social change. A good joke can spread far and wide and can be a powerful tool, especially when it is used to criticise or mock power in environments where it is difficult to do that in a direct way. In Egypt, while activists were trying to mobilise people against the Mubarack's regime we got tonnes of contributions from practically unknown young people on the internet of humorous images that are basically remixing of film posters depicting the face of the President in place of famous villains and thugs and thieves and members of organised crime or whatever to make a statement about the current situation.
For sex workers from the Asia Pacific Network Kareoke provides a common language, even when they do not have another language in common. The group's karaoke videos have been screened across the region at parties, performances and in front of audiences of thousands such as at an international HlV/AlDS conference.
One video received nearly 10,000 views online on YouTube and Blip.tv A different example of how humour can be used came in the form of a birthday gift to Belarus's President, Alexander Lukashenko after he complained publicly that the internet was too anarchic and announced plans to tighten content restrictions.
Activists responded with an online campaign that sought to mock what they saw to be propagandising government-controlled media. Humour is the first step to break taboos and to break fears. So by making people laugh about dangerous stuff
It's called 'Give Luchenko his net' Because Luchenko made statements accusing the internet of playing against the government of Belarus saying 'their is a lot of untrue content there'.
So the Belarusian activists made a clone of YouTube and Live Journal And published their stuff, very funny videos and humorous cartoons about President Luchenko This kind of use of tools that are easily identifiable by internet users, but switching the content to something political and shaping it in a humourous pattern that makes fun and it makes political accounting interesting.
Websites, karaoke video clips and film posters are just three ways to convey a serious message in a light, yet effective way. Sometimes an overlooked part of info-activism work is the value of maintaining and sustaining healthy networks. Networks are power in the digital age and exploiting them fully requires planning and time.
I am personally involved in a project called CiviCRM which is a free and open source software built especially for non-profit organisations and advocacy groups. It has been built with a lot of feedback from all those groups so in my personal opinion it's basically an excellent tool for managing contact information.
FrontlineSMS is a different kind of software that also supports targeted, network communication this time, specifically using SMS. Well managing contacts is obviously important from an organisational point of view but speaking from the perspective of the someone you are communicating with the last thing they want to be receiving is messages or information that they are not concerned about, that does not interest them, is not relevant to them. So if you're running multiple campaigns clearly you don't want to be sending the wrong groups of people the wrong messages.
A good example of how FrontlineSMS is being used to help send targeted messages and communicate with targeted groups was during the reconstruction efforts after the Asian Tsunami where a project being run by Mercy Corps was looking to have conversations and send specific information to a different number of groups.
So using FrontlineSMS they were able to group people into different categories and these people included farmers, who might want to know the coffee prices in different markets, Government Ministers who wanted summary information on the different market prices being charged in different areas other people wanted weather forecasts.
Using FrontlineSMS and using the grouping facility and functionality within the software they were able to put people into multiple groups depending on what information they wanted to receive and then they could target those people with an SMS providing them with that market price, or that weather report or whatever the information might be. If you want to manage your contact information in your info-activism work you need to be systematic you need to try to integrate information collection on almost all the levels After some time, well I will not hide it, it's an effort!
Databases, client relationship management systems and bulk text messaging software are three tools you can use to manage your contacts and to sustain healthy and productive relationships with the people who want to support you.
Sometimes issues are very complicated. They may involve issues that have been evolving for a long time or they may be connected with many events and many different people. To enable an issue to be understood you may need to find out what information exists and whether you have a legal right to access it.
Farmsubsidy.org is an initiative that lobbies for access to information about government farm subsidies across the European Union. It aims to ensure that journalists and civil society are able to scrutinise how the billions of euros of funding allocated for farm subsidies is spent.
Within our campaign at farmsubsidy.org when we're successful we're almost faced with an avalanche of information. Deciding which information to draw the attention of the media to is very difficult If you've got an enormous data set and you're trying to find out ways to present it to people one really good way of doing that is to make it relevant to them in their locality, in the area where they live.
A project I was involved with was the featured layers on the Darfur Crisis in Goggle Earth. We were a team of about a dozen people assembled by the United States Holocaust Museum. They wanted to, in a very engaging way raise awareness of what was happening in Darfur.
We had a great amount of information -- spreadsheets, photos, videos plus the base layers in Google Earth themselves which were recently updated satellite images often showing villages that had been destroyed in Darfur. We spent about six months working with that data to really pay proper respect to the situation there so that we could convey a powerful message. It got great coverage by Google and in the media and thousands, maybe even hundreds of thousands of people have seen those layers and it's greatly raised awareness of the issues there.
Swarming is what happens when people's experiences and knowledge are pulled together to create a combined effect far greater than their individual acts.
As the 2008 Mumbai attacks unfolded, a swarm was created using Twitter.
A microblogging service that allows people to send and read each others personal updates via the internet and mobile phones. When the Mumbai terror attacks were happening there were a lot of us within the vicinity and we started pouring out our emotions and talking about what was going on and what we were seeing on television into Twitter. We were feeling like 'what do we do?' and we were feeling alone in our homes because we weren't allowed to get out and it allowed us to feel less alone, less angry as a group and we able to actually network with people on the ground to bring out information that was required.
One software program, FrontlineSMS allowed text messages to be sent and received by large numbers of subscribers in Madagascar while Ushahidi allowed subscribers messages to show on a map.
In 2009, during the troubles in Madagascar where I believe some demonstrators were shot by the army there was clearly an opportunity there to collect information and news and voices of people on the ground who were experiencing the troubles, who were involved in the demonstrations and who were impacted by what was going on. Using technologies you can combine the collective voice of people so people can SMS in information, they can send in emails, they can complete online forms. You can then aggregate that information with the news coming in from the mainstream and then bringing all that together you get a much better picture of what's happening on the ground.
Ushahidi, the crowd sourcing platform, which used FrontlineSMS to allow people to text a number and then contribute to the news through their mobile phones so people could go to the internet and send emails or they could go onto a website and complete a form.
People generally prefer, due to convenience and speed, sending an SMS and FrontlineSMS was used to collect those messages which was then posted to the Ushahidi site and from that point they were aggregated with the other reports coming in including information from the mainstream media and then placed on a map and it gave a very good idea of where the hotspots of the trouble were and it gave a much broader view of what was happening in the country than otherwise would have been given.
As these examples illustrate, mobile phones, when connected with online platforms can be a powerful way to combine experiences and knowledge to report events comprehensively as they unfold. Technology that listens is technology that responds to individual information needs. One example is Infonet's budget tracking platform which allows people to send free SMS enquiries about the allocation of funding for development projects in their local area.
Infonet's budget tracking platform has led to a number of discoveries of misused funds. By leaking these findings to government and mainstream media
Infonet has been able to ensure that corruption has been addressed and citizen efforts have been rewarded with action. Recent developments have greatly increased the ways technology can listen and respond to people's needs. The phone used to be something that was controlled by the telecommunications monopolies and over the last few years, there's been a whole renaissance in telephony technology that's built around voiceover IP.
You can now run your own phone company on free software. What that means is you can do all of the creative call centre and interactive voice menus and that kind of stuff on your own phone system or on your own home computer so many activist groups will now set up a call-in line. Using their own phone system, the Kubatana Trust of Zimbabwe developed a platform that ensured citizens were informed via an SMS about where they could vote in government elections.
To address this, Kubatana are now developing 'Freedom Fone'. A system that uses voice recognition rather than text to provide people with information.
The Freedom Fone project is being built out so that each group can take a copy of this software and run it on their own system and simply provide the menus of what kind of information they are going to access and provide.
Freedom Fone registers that they called and the phone system calls them back so the organisation is able to cover all the costs. There is a tool that has been overlooked I think by the development sector and that's the area of interactive voice response. We believe that if we can make this an easier device to use by non-profits that we will see people reach out to their communities using dial-up information services which would become almost the poor person's equivalent of the internet, being able to dial up for information when you need it.
Designing and using technologies that can listen to people's needs and respond quickly can be a good way to quickly address immense gaps in information and improve information flows. When corruption and right's abuses are being committed by those with the most power such as governments, multinational companies, police or the military It is sometimes necessary to investigate and expose what is going on.
'Torture in Egypt' was started at the time when torture was not highlighted enough, at all. Torture crimes were rarely mentioned on TV It was not very interesting to mainstream media.
Because what they were reading in 'Torture in Egypt' that was really shocking. By uncovering human rights abuses in Egypt through though this blog, Noha has managed to correct some serious injustices.
The story of the Tunisian aeroplane video began when a friend of mine, Tunisian activist and blogger was searching the internet for photos related to aeroplanes in Tunisia and he found the image of the Tunisian Presidential aeroplane in a website for jetspotters -- people who share photos of planes they have taken in airports. He kept on searching and found more than 20 photos of the same Presidential aeroplane in different airports in Europe.
So he went to the Tunisian Presidential website and took the list of the official trips of the Tunisian President and compared that with the photos with dates and places of the photos of the Presidential plane in Europe and he found out that only one trip was official So the question that he asked was 'Who is using the Tunisian aeroplane and why?'
He published that on YouTube and engaged the Tunisian blogosphere to talk about issues of transparency and the abuse of power. Big mainstream media like foreign policy magazine published the story and investigated the case and said that the Tunisian aeroplane was used by the first lady of Tunisia for some personal shopping in luxury shops in Europe. As a result of the public attention this video received the government in Tunisia blocked YouTube and another popular video sharing site, Dailymotion.
Despite this, this story, like the Torture in Egypt blog shows how the internet can be used both as a tool to investigate abuses of power and to broadcast and spread the truth. As digital tools become cheaper, more widespread and easier to use our ability to access, analyse and share information grows. By linking new technologies with creative thinking communities and advocates can transform information into powerful action that defends and promotes human rights.
Tactical Tech have been working with rights advocates to use information for advocacy for over a decade.
We'll now learn about what is arguably the most useful concept in finance and that is called the present value. And if you know the present value then it's very easy to understand the net present value and the discounted cash flow and the internal rate of return and we'll eventually learn all of those things. But the present value, what does that mean?
Present value. So let's do a little exercise. I could pay you a hundred dollars today.
It is guaranteed, so there's no risk here. So it's just a notion of You're definitely gonna get $100 today, in your hand or you're definitely gonna get $110 one year from now.
Sal, just give me the money in a year and give me $110 you're gonna end up with more money in a year. You're gonna end up with $110. And that is actually the right way to think about it.
So what if we wanted to go in the other direction?
If we have a certain amount of money and we want to figure out today's value what could we do? Well to go from here to here, what did we do? We essentially took $100 and we multiplied by 1+5%.
And then we will get the present value And the notation is PV We'll get the present value of $110 a year from now.
It's currently 2008 I don't know what year you're watching this video in. Hopefully people will be watching this in the next millenia.
In the last video, I've mentioned how I've been asked to make predicitons for the year 2060. In the last one I've focused on education, that's obviously what I'm working on now, and I have some opinions on that. But what I want to do in this video is do maybe slightly more broad and wild predictions, and my one prediction I'll make is on probably not going to predict the real reality of 2060 and the probably big things to predict, I will completely miss.
I think a similar thing with this is we are going to see more and more non-lethal weapons, which, once again, it is very similar to this, it sounds like it is a good thing, you know, if there is a gun that instead of having to kill someone, it encompasses them in some way, stuns them in some, kind of the classic Star Trek 'put your phasers on stun' things. The, I guess, scarier version of non-lethal weapons is the treshold for using it becomes much lower. So for government, you know, once to subjected citizens are subjected to another group of citizens, it can literally just stun them, make them pass out or control them in some way, so this could be a little bit scarier.
I told you in the last video on calendar notation that regardless of whether you're using BC/AD or BCE and CE, that there is no year zero, that we had 1BC and then we had that theoretical birth of Jesus and most historians don't think he was born right exactly on 1 January 1AD but there is no year zero right after that you go from 31 December 1BC to 1 January 1AD. There's no year zero. And despite the fact that I emphasized in the last video,
In this video we're gonna talk about the law of demand which is one of the core ideas of micro-economics.
And luckily for us, it is a fairly intuitive idea. It just tells us that if we raise the price of a product, that will lower the quantity demanded for the product. The quantity demanded will go down, and you can imagine the other side of that.
Let's call this a scenario A. I could price my book at $2. And I'll get a ton of people downloading it at that price.
Scenario B, I could raise the price by $2. So it's now at $4 and then that kills off a lot of the demand. Now the quantity demanded goes down to 40,000 people downloading it.
Then I go to scenario C. If I raise by another $2, so now I'm at $6, that lowers the quantity demanded to 30,000. I will do a couple more of these.
Scenario E, I raise it to $10. Now the quantity demanded let's just say it is 23,000. So this relationship, this shows the law of demand right over here.
Scenario B, when the price is $4, 40,000 units are demanded. $4, 40,000 units that's right over there.
That's Scenario B.
Scenario C, $6, 30,000 units.
Scenario D, $8, 25,000 units. $8, 25 is right about there. That looks like 25,000 right in between. That's close enough.
So that right over there is Scenario D. And then finally Scenario E, $10, 23,000 units. So that would be something like that.
That is Scenario E. And so we can actually have prices anywhere between them and maybe we can go even further. So this right over here.
I have a square here divided into one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine equal sections. And we've already seen that if we were to shade in one of these sections, if we were to select one of these sections, let's say the middle one right over here, this is one out of the nine equal sections.
We have one, two, three, four, five, six equal sections. And we see that one, two, three, four are shaded in. So 4/6 of this figure is shaded in.
We have one, two, three, four, five equal sections. And one, two, three, four are shaded in. So here, 4/5 of this circle is shaded in.
I now want to re-figure out what this mystery mass is, but we're going to start using a little bit more of mathematics. And mathematics really are just a language of symbols for representing ideas -- for representing relationships between things. And so the first thing I want you to do is think about if you can express a relationship mathematically between this side of the scale and that side of the scale.
Well just have 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 kg. So we just have 10 on the right hand side. And what else do we know?

There are a lot of ways the people around us can help improve our lives. We don't bump into every neighbor, so a lot of wisdom never gets passed on, though we do share the same public spaces. So over the past few years, I've tried ways to share more with my neighbors in public space, using simple tools like stickers, stencils and chalk.
Now, I live in New Orleans, and I am in love with New Orleans. My soul is always soothed by the giant live oak trees, shading lovers, drunks and dreamers for hundreds of years, and I trust a city that always makes way for music. I feel like every time someone sneezes,
New Orleans has a parade. (Laughter) The city has some of the most beautiful architecture in the world, but it also has one of the highest amounts of abandoned properties in America.
"Before I die, I want to ..." So anyone walking by can pick up a piece of chalk, reflect on their life, and share their personal aspirations in public space. I didn't know what to expect from this experiment, but by the next day, the wall was entirely filled out, and it kept growing.
Twenty teachers were asked about their favorite course. Seven teachers said language. Three teachers said history.
[Male narrator] In this case, there's nothing to add because of the 2 neighbors, 1 is in the explored list and 1 is in the frontier, and if we're using graph search, then we won't add either of those.
Hi I'm Bobak Ferdowsi, flight director with the Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity and this is your Curiosity rover update. This week, we did a color panorama surrounding the rover with both the Mastcam, and the Nav cams, and we also upgraded the software on board on both computers of the rover this week. This new software is like having new applications with new functionalities on the rover to allow us to do mobility, deploy the arm and get to the science that we're looking forward to on the mission.
RAD science.
REMS
APXS
SAM And the additional cameras on the rover, including the MAHLI instrument. We also downlinked some MARDI high-resolution data images.
We've got 6798 minus 3359. So let's see how far we can get with the subtraction. So immediately when we're going to the one's place, we're going to subtract a 9 from an 8.
Photography has been my passion ever since I was old enough to pick up a camera, but today I want to share with you the 15 most treasured photos of mine, and I didn't take any of them. There were no art directors, no stylists, no chance for reshoots, not even any regard for lighting. In fact, most of them were taken by random tourists.
My story begins when I was in New York City for a speaking engagement, and my wife took this picture of me holding my daughter on her first birthday. We're on the corner of 57th and 5th. We happened to be back in New York exactly a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
So I want to encourage everyone today to get in the shot, and don't hesitate to go up to someone and ask, "Will you take our picture?" Thank you.
A ticket agent sells 42 tickets to a play. The tickets cost $29 each. Use rounding to estimate the total dollars taken in from the sale of the tickets.
Your personal ancestry story begins with a shared story of our human ancestry.
You and your distant cousin, the chimpanzee, had a common ancestor, which lived about 6 and 1/2 million years ago. We can learn about this common ancestor by noting what makes us similar to chimps. But many things also distinguish us from chimpanzees,
By this time, as a result of previous migrations, Homo erectus was living across Asia, and had been for 2 million years. Homo erectus had a big brain.
They made spears and stone tools similar to those found in Africa. And we suspect they had strong social relationships. They cared for their sick and infirmed and buried their dead, not so very different culturally from early Homo sapiens.
Is (3, -4) a solution to the equation 5x + 2y = 7? So they're saying,
"Does x equal 3, y equal negative 4 satisfy this equation, or this relationship right here?" So one way to do it is to substitute x is equal to 3 and y is equal to negative 4 into this and see if 5 times x plus 2 times y does indeed equal 7 So we have 5 times 3 plus 2 times -4
Now we mixed up things a little bit more: on the left side of the scale, not only do we have these identical unknown masses with mass X, these three blue things, we also have some of the 1kg masses over here, actually, we have two of them. Now, we are going to figure out wat X is. But before we even do that, I want you to think about a mathematical equation that can represent what is going on; that equates what we have on the left hand, with what we have on the right side of the scale.
So let's think about what we have on the left side: we have 3 masses with mass X, so you can say we have 3x and then we have 2 masses of 1 kilogram, so in total we have 2 kg. So + 2. So one way to think about the total mass on the left-hand side is 3x + 2.
Three masses with mass X, plus two kilograms. That is what we have on the left-hand side. Now, let us think about what we have on the right-hand side.
The easiest way to think about it is: If I want one X on this left-hand side, that is a third of the total X's here. So what if I were to multiply the left-hand side by one-third --
Let's do a small experiment Would you rather drink this water, or this water? Well, of course you would choose the water on the left
Here we see four beakers of water with increasing levels of turbidity, from left to right. There is a relation between turbidity and the risk of getting a disease. Science shows that the more turbid the drinking water is, the higher the risk of getting sick is.
The more colloids there are, the more toxic the water can become.
These toxic materials and bacteria can cause cholera, salmonellosis, hepatitis A, dysentery, and e-coli infection. These illnesses effect and kill millions of people a year, and are especially dangerous to children, whose weak immune systems cannot provide an adequate defense. Fortunately, we can do something about this!
Flocculation is the process in which colloids aggregate, or come together to form larger particles called flocks, by the addition of a chemical called a flocculant.
Typical flocculants include Alum and Ferrix, because they work well with high turbidity fluid mixtures
Now, let's demonstrate how flocculation works. First, we'll need to go out and collect some muddy water from the Charles River Here are two beakers filled with the same amount of muddy Charles River water
Wow! What just happened? The colloids in the turbid water on the left may never settle whereas, with the addition of just a little bit of flocculant the water on the right became clear.
In order to make this water potable, it will require skimming and filtration and maybe some additional treatment If you're wondering what's going on, let's explain how this flocculant business works. Almost all colloids have negatively charged surfaces
A diffuse layer, made up of a mix of positive and negative ions will then surround the first forming what is called a double layer. This double layer provides a repulsive force which prevents two colloids from sticking to each other.
Once the flocculant is added, it adheres to the surfaces of the particles, compressing the double layer, and allowing the colloids to stick to each other and form "flocks" These flocks are now heavy enough to settle to the bottom by gravity. Given how effective flocculation is, many countries around the world use this method for cleaning their water supplies.
As the global population increases and freshwater resources become more and more scarce flocculation is one tool that can supply clean, healthy, and tasty drinking water worldwide.
Hi, I'm John Green, and this is the final episode of Crash Course World History, not because we've reached the end of history, but because we've reached the particular middle where I happen to be living.
Mr. Green, Mr. Green!
What I wanna do in this video is step trough the insertion sort function that we wrote in the last video.
But before I do that I actually just want to focus on one part of it, cuz I realized that I used something that you probably don't reckognize cuz we haven't used it before. I used... I used the keyword right over here.
I used BREAK and you might guess what BREAK means, but now I'll explain it explicitly.
What BREAK means is: Break out of the smallest loop that you were doing so we were taking our item and we were kept comparing it to the thing to the left of it. We were taking value and kept comparing it to the left of it and as soon as we found value not beeing less than something to the left of it we said:
Let's just define a to be equal to... let me think about a fairly simple list... 2, 1... I don't konw... 2, 1, 3, 2. I think it's a good list over there and let's assume that we are calling insertion_sort... insertion_sort... insertion_sort on a.
Let's keep track of all of the variables here so one of... so list is right from the get code going to refer to:
For index in range and let's parse this part right over here.
So what is LEN of the list. So LEN of our list is the same thing as LEN of 2, 1, 3, 2 and this is just really the number of elements. LEN is short for length.
Not that much shorter, but LEN of this is just going to be one, two, three, four. It's going to be equal to 4 elements. So this right over here is going to be 4 and on the call RANGE between 1 and LEN of list is 4.
What is the first element of the list? This is the 0th element, this is the 1st element so we are looking at this right over here. This is...
This index is 1, this is 0 and then we are saying WHlLE i is greater than or equal to 0 do all of this bussiness over here and the first thing that we do over here is we compare value... we compare value to the object that is at the i'th element of the list.
So let me write that over here. So list... list at i. So that is going to be the 0th element in the list.
Hei it's less than that so it's less than that. Let's shift this 2 to the right and let's shift 1 to the left and so we go into here and we say list i plus 1. So what's i plus 1?
In this time around this is 2 and this is the slot where the 1 was so we are going to put this.. we are going to replace that with 2 and then in the place where the 2 was we are going to replace it with value and remember value was set to 1. So value is set to 1 and so our list now looks like 1, 2, 3, 2 and hopefully this looks familiar if you remember when we first described the insertion_sort algorithm. So we go trough there and we don't... and then we... and now we want to decrement i.
And then we go to the WHlLE loop and it says while i is greater than or equal to 0. Well i is now negative 1 so the WHlLE loop no longer applies. This will return false.
Index is 2. 2 minus 1 is... 2 minus 1 is 1. So this is...
So the value is 3 and is that less than... well what's at list i is no longer 2. So what in the first element. Well it actually still is 2. so it still is a 2.
Value is now 2 and now... and now i is 2... i is... oh let me... i is index minus 1. So 3 minus 1 so that is 2.
So i is now going to be 2 and the object that is at list at the 2th element on the list, 0, 1, 2, is now going to be... is now going to be 3. And so the first thing we do while i is greater or equal to 0 while i is clearly greater or equal to 0. It's 2 right now.
Value is still 2.
Remember 2 is what we are comparing and while we go trough this WHlLE loop we are comparing to each of the items to the left. If 2 is less than whatever is at the i'th slot in the list. So the first slot in the list is 2.

Thank you very much. Now, I've got a story for you. When I arrived off the plane, after a very long journey from the West of England, my computer, my beloved laptop, had gone mad, and had -- oh! -- a bit like that! -- and the display on it -- anyway, the whole thing had burst.

What I want to do in this video is think about the idea of fraction. And for the sake of this video, as we learn what a fraction is, you can think of it as a part of a whole. Later on we will think of it in even more ways.
and let's say I divide it into 4 equal parts.
So there is a total of 4 equal slices of pizza. And let's say on 3 of these slices I have cheese, only cheese.
The table below shows solar panel installations by state during the last fiscal year. How many total solar panels were installed last year in Wyoming?
We're asked to simplify 5x squared plus 8x minus 3 plus 2x squared minus 7x plus 13x. So really, all we have to do is we have to combine like terms-- terms that have x raised to the same power. And the first thing we can do, we can actually get rid of these parentheses right here, because we have this whole expression, and then we're adding it to this whole expression.
Man: I love to find out where things come from. The question mark is Carolingian.
F of x is equal to 2 x times the principal square root of 5 minus 4. G of x is equal to x squared plus 2 x times the principal squared root of 5 minus 1. Find g minus f of x.
We're asked to solve for y. So we're told that the negative of the cube root of y is equal to 4 times the cube root of y plus 5. So in all of these it's helpful to just be able to isolate the cube root, isolate the radical in the equation, and then solve from there.
So you're going to have negative 5 times the cube root of y. That's your left-hand side. Now the right-hand side-- these two guys-- cancel out.
We've already seen that fractions could be used to represent parts of wholes. Now we're going to extend that idea a little bit to think about them as actual numbers on the number line. So let me draw a number line right over here.
That entire set of 23 human chromosomes is called a genome. The human genome is composed of 3 billion base pairs.
Variation at a single base pair is called a SNP, or single nucleotide polymorphism.
When the body makes new cells, it doesn't make many mistakes, but nobody is perfect. Sometimes, when the genome is copied, to make a new cell, a single base pair gets lift out, added, or substituted. Single base pair substitutions create SNPs.
There're around 10 million SNPs in the human genome, which account for many of the genetic differences between you and everyone else on the planet. Some SNPs account for differences in appearance, others can affect how we develop diseases, or respond to drugs. Most SNPs, however, seemed to lead to no observable differences between people at all.
Good morning or evening or whatever it is where you are, wherever you're happening to watch this movie. Anyway, I've been requested to do a playlist on probability, and I think that's an excellent idea, so I will start doing a playlist on probability.
So let's do a playlist on probability. It's a good place to start probability.
I don't do videos on spelling.
Probability: so what is it? And I think all of us have kind of a sense of it, very informally.
And as far as I can tell there actually isn't a formal definition of what a probability is. There are several almost formal competing definitions. So just in our everyday life, you know if the weather man says there's a 50% percent chance of rain the next day, he's essentially giving a probability.
Why grow homes? Because we can. Right now, America is in an unremitting state of trauma.
We've got McPeople, McCars, McHouses. As an architect, I have to confront something like this. So what's a technology that will allow us to make ginormous houses?
We use CNC to make scaffolding to train semi-epithetic matter, plants, into a specific geometry that makes a home that we call a Fab Tree Hab.
It fits into the environment. It is the environment. It is the landscape, right?
We had a big show in Prague, and we decided to put it in front of the cathedral so religion can confront the house of meat. That's why we grow homes. Thanks very much.
We have to rewrite the following fractions with fraction with least common denominator So LCD of the 2 fractions is going to be the LCM of both of these denominators over here. and if we can make this as common denominators we can add the two fractions First let us find the LCM,
and lets do the same things with 5/6 5/6 = / 24, i will do it in a different colour, blue to get the denominator from 6 to 24, we need to multiply by 4, so we need to multiply numerator also by 4 so 5x4 = 20 5/6 = 20/24 so we have written both the fractions with common denominator So we are done
We are asked to identify the percent amount and base in this problem. They ask us 150 is 25% of what number? So another way to think about it is 25% times some number, so I will do 25% in yellow.
So this number needs to be larger than 150. If fact, it has to be larger than 150 by 4. And to actually figure out what this number is we can actually multiply, since what is on the left hand side is equal to what is on the right hand side.
What I want to do in this video is talk a little bit about compounding interest and then have a little bit of a discussion of a way to quickly, kind of an approximate way, to figure out how quickly something compounds.
You get 1.1 to the x is equal to 2. I just divided both sides by 100. Then you could take the logarithm of both sides base 1.1, and you get x.
What I'm going to do in the next video is I'm going to explain something called the Rule of 72, which is an approximate way to figure out how long, to answer this question, how long does it take to double your money?
